# This repo scraps incidence data from the [airwars](https://airwars.org/) website to produce a dataframe with event data on each Hamas casualty produced by airwars as a result of an Israel attack since October 2023.
- There are two scripts, one for scraping the event metadata and the other that takes this information and scraps each event.
-  Data is stored in both a parquet and csv file.
