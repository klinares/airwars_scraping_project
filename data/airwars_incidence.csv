According to the tribute by the Twitter/X account @GazaMartyrs, Omar was injured and bled to death in a remote, uninhabited area and ”quietly became a martyr, as tranquil as his serenity.”Omar went out to pray Fajr (Islamic prayer) on October 7th but was killed by an Israeli missile strike, the sources reported. It was his morning ritual to pray Fajr in the mosque, go for a morning run, and return home with breakfast for his parents and wife and sweets for his three-year-old daughter Elena. He did not know about the major Hamas attack inside Israel on the same morning and therefore went about his activities as normal.Omar Abu Shawish founded various youth associations and has won multiple local and international awards. He won the “Best National Song of the Year 2007” at the International Festival of National Song and Heritage in Jordan. In 2010, he won the “Distinguished Volunteer and Ideal Young” award at the Sharek Youth Forum in Palestine. In 2013, he was presented the “Distinguished Arab Youth in the Field of Media, Journalism and Culture” award by the Arab Youth Council for Integrated Development of the Arab League. In 2016 he published his novel, “Ala gayd al-mawt” and several poem collections. He participated in many local, Arab and international conferences. He had experience in leadership, planning capacity building and creative work and took initiatives in various cultural, literature and community work fields.A lot of tributes to the deceased poet were published on social media platforms, including ones from the Palestinian Ministry of Culture and the General Union of Palestinian Writers and Authors. His family members and friends also mourned his death.Omar’s sister Alaa Fares wrote: “My beloved brother, Al-Fares / Omar Fares Abu Shawish… God has chosen you today as the first martyr in the battle of liberation and victory (Al-Aqsa Flood).” Indeed, Omar was one of the first civilians killed since the beginning of the conflict on October 7th. Alaa added that she was still waiting for his visit.Omar’s friend Fadi Saidam shared an image taken with Omar and wrote: “Goodbye, my friend.. May God have mercy on you. You were light-hearted, creative, polite, and shy person who gave without limits.”Fathiyya Sarsour made a heartfelt tribute through his post. He described Omar as “a name unlike other names, a human being that words cannot describe. Taste and modesty are his characteristics. Loyalty and love of goodness are his nature. A gentle and creative human being in all fields.”Hussam A. Shawish wrote in his post about Omar that “the stout, well-mannered person, with a smiling face, elegant appearance, big heart, and gentle manners, the one with a permanent smile and wonderful words, the writer and intellectual, the clasher, who hurt the enemy’s legions with his words, stepped out.”Abu Hasan Ali in his post recalled his last interaction with Omar fares Abu Shawish. Omar and his daughter visited Abu Hasan place. “Oh God, I can’t believe it. The day before yesterday, he was sitting at my place and his little daughter was with him. He greeted me and laughed and left and did not come back.”Family members and friends shared numerous images of Omar where he was seen as a middle-aged man with a kind smile. In one of the images he was playing a traditional musical instrument, and in another, he was seen with his three-year-old daughter kissing him on the cheek.The name of the late Omar has been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where the sources identified the belligerent, sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The incident occured in the morning., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee campCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 man1 journalist)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 man1 journalist)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 man1 journalist)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Mohammad Al Najjar was remembered as a well-behaved high school student of 2006 in a Facebook post by Bumat El-Ghad Foundation.Other members of the Al Najjar family, namely, the wife of their son Salah, Afnan Al Najjar, her son Sanad Salah Al Najjar and her daughter Ayah Salah Al Najjar, are also among the victims of the tragic incident.On Facebook, the Al-Najjar family page listed the members of the family who had been killed, including Ayah Salah Hamdan Al-Najjar, the young granddaughter of Hajj Hamdan Al-Najjar.

Based on the time of publication of these sources, Airwars concluded that the attack might have been conducted between 7pm and 8.30pm local time.Other sources, such as Palsawa news, reported on the incident the morning of October 8th, at around 9 am. However, it seems that sources referred to when rescue efforts were taking place, and to the moment where victims were pulled from the rubble. It was initially reported by Palsawa news that three killed and three injured people who had been brought to the European Hospital. Later on, while Khuza’a Municipality crews were removing the rubble of the destroyed house, the bodies of Afnan Al Najjar and Ehtiram Al Najjar were recovered from the rubble.A son of Hajj Hamdan Al Najjar, Zakaria H.Al Najjar, mentioned in his heartfelt Facebook testimony Sanad Salah Al Najjar and Ayah Salah Al Najjar among the victims, thus confirming that the strike had killed seven members of the Al Najjar family.Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

The home was located in the Al-Satriya neighborhood in the Al-Shaboura refugee camp in Rafah, and was completely destroyed.Al Mezan reported that 17 civilians, including women and children, were killed by an Israeli attack on the home of the Abu Qouta in Rafah. At the time of reporting, there were still civilians under the rubble. Defense for Children Palestine identified that five children were among the 17 killed by an Israeli airstrike which fired one missile at the Shaboura refugee camp.An AP News article provided details that the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning to the neighbors of the Abu Qouta family and then launched a warning shot a short distance from Nasser Abu Qouta’s home, meant to convey that they should evacuate. However, once Abu Qouta and his extended family sheltered around 100 meters away from the house that was alerted to the strike on the ground floor of their four-story building, where they thought they would be safe, the strike hit Abu Qouta’s house instead, killing 19 members of his family, including his wife and cousins, as well as five of his neighbors who were standing outside.Nasser Abu Qouta told AP that there were no militants in his building, and his family had not been warned: “This is a safe house, with children and women. Dust overwhelmed the house. There were screams. There were no walls. It was all open.” Abu Qouta was able to identify the bodies of 14 of his family members, but four of the children’s bodies were unrecognizable and one body was missing. Some of the children and grandchildren of Abu Qouta were also wounded in the strike.Arabi 21 spoke with another relative of the family named Bakr Abu Qouta who provided additional details: “The entire family was sitting at home safely, the children were playing and eating, and suddenly we did not realize what had happened; the house was turned upside down.

At least 21 members of the large Al Zaneen family were killed across three generations: 66-year old Jamil Hassan Muhammad Al Zaneen (Abu Muhammad) and his wife Salma Hussein Muhammad Al Zaneen, together with their three sons, Dr. Mohammed Jameel Al Zaneen, Hussam Jameel Al Zaneen and Hamza Jameel Al Zaneen, and their sons’ wives and children.The large four-storey house housed around thirty people overall, and was reported to be completely destroyed. Initially Wattan news reported that nine members of the Al Zaneen family were killed, and some were wounded in a critical condition. But later most sources reported that 21 people, including 11 children (five boys and six girls) and five women, were killed. Their remains were transferred to the Indonesian hospital as they were removed from the rubble by Palestinian medical and civil defense teams, according to the Defense for Children International Palestine. In total, Airwars identified the names of 22 victims from Al Zaneen family through local reporting and relatives obituaries: 12 children, five women and five men killed in the bombing. Only one source, @fidaazaanin, also recorded the death of Jamil Hassan Muhammad Al Zaneen (Abu Muhammad). As such, Airwars estimated that between 21 to 22 civilians were killed in the airstrike.Dr. Mohammed Jameel Al Zaneen was one of the doctoral student graduates at the University of Islamic Sciences Malaysia USIM. The Malaysia Branch of the General Union of Palestine Students honoured his memory in a dedicated post and extended its deepest condolences and sympathy to Al Zaneen family.Dr. Al Zaneen was on vacation with his family in the Gaza Strip at the time of the attack. His wife Kholoud Muhammad Hassan Al Zaneen and their four sons – a twelve-year old Hasan Muhammad Jamil Al Zaneen, a nine-year old Obaida Muhammad Jamil Al Zaneen, a seven-year old Khaled Muhammad Jamil Al Zaneen, and four-year old Amr Muhammad Jamil Al Zaneen lost their lives in this tragic incident, survived only by one son.Maruwan Alshireedi remembers that just the day before the attack the five sons of Dr. Mohammed Al Zaneen were reciting and memorizing the Qur’an with him. He wrote in a heartfelt testimony: “The eyes shed tears and the heart grieves, and people are sad to hear this news. Abaqa Biladi, a teacher of the two older Al Zaneen’s sons, wrote in a Facebook post: “Khaled and Obaida were my polite and intelligent students”.Another son of Salma Hussein Muhammad Al Zaneen, Hussam Jameel Al Zaneen, killed in the strike as highlighted above, will be remembered for his “beautiful qualities, good morals, and unprecedented calm”, according to the Facebook testimony by his friend Qasem Abo Sido. He was killed together with his wife Heba Ismail Hussein Al Zaneen, their twelve-year old son Mouamen Hussam Jamil Zaneen and their five daughters – Misk Hussam Jamil Al Zaneen, a nine-year old Nour Hussam Jamil Al Zaneen, a seven-year old Zaina Hussam Jamil Al Zaneen, a five-year old Mais Hussam Jamil Al Zaneen, and a one year-old Hala Hussam Jamil Al Zaneen.Also killed in the strike were Diana Mahmoud Muhammad Atta Al Zaneen, Risala Al Zaneen, and her two daughters, a five-year old Salma Omar Jameel Al Zaneen and a three-year old Balsam Omar Jameel Al Zaneen. Diana and Risala were reported to be the daughters-in-law of of Jamil al Zaneen. A post from Mohannad Mustafa Al Zaneen also indicated that Risala was pregnant at the time she was killed. Their cousin Anas Muhammad Hassan Al Zaneen was also among the victims.Journalist Hani Abu Razouk documented a poignant clip of a woman from the Al Zaneen family crying after more than 20 members of her family were killed. She said: “All of them were martyred. All of them died. All of them went. More than 20 people in the house. They bombed them without warning.”The photojournalist shared another clip of a woman crying for her daughter after she was killed in the bombing, saying, “My daughter is gone… she’s gone, for God’s sake, tell me if she is alive!”Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

On Twitter, one source commented on the attack: “The family of Hajj #Fathi Al-Nabahin and his children, his children’s wives and his children’s children #east of Al-Bureij camp are all under the rubble. A large family (father, children and grandchildren)”.The names and ages of 14 of the civilians killed were provided by Al-Mezan Center for Human Rights – and 10 of them were reconciled with the list of victims killed published by the Palestinian Ministry of Health on October 26th: Ola Al-Muqadamah Al-Nabahin (wife of Fadi Fathi Al-Nabahin), Hadeel Abdel Fattah Attiya al-Nabahin (25), Ola Ziyad Abdel Aziz al-Nabahin (26), Areeh Fadi Fathi al-Nabahin (9), Muhammad Fadi Fathi al-Nabahin (8), Adam Fadi Fathi al-Nabahin (7), Qais Fadi Fathi al-Nabahin (2), Kenan Tamer Fathi Attiya al-Nabahin (7 or 8 year-old, depending on local sources, son of Tamer al-Nabahin), Rayan Tamer Fathi Attiya al-Nabahin (5, son of Tamer al-Nabahin), Maryam Tamer Fathi Attiya al-Nabahin (2, daughter of Tamer al-Nabahin), Jamal Ibrahim Attiya al-Nabahin (7), Muhammad Jaafar Attiya al-Nabahin (13 or 15), Rahaf Jaafar Attiya al-Nabahin (15 or 16), and Attiya Fathi Attiya al-Nabahin (24). On Twitter/X, Nihad Abo Ghayoun also identified a fifteenth victim, a woman, Halima Al-Nabahin, without indicating her age. He claimed that six bodies of Al-Nabahin members were initially transported to Al-Aqsa hospital. Multiple sources on social and local media confirmed the strikes and the victims’ details, including the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, the Al-Haq Foundation and the Adalah Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel. According to the Adalah Center and Al-Mezan Center, both organisations had been representing the 24 year old victim Attiya Fathi Attia al-Nabahin in a long-term legal battle since 2014 to demand civil compensation after he was injured at the age of 15 by Israeli sniper fire, which left him permanently paralyzed from the neck down.Osama Burhem, Attiya’s friend, also shared similar details about this story on social media, recalling in a tearful text that “a soldier shot him for no reason”, adding “this day/The same soldier bombed the whole house / May Attiya and most of his family ascend to heaven (…) This child who was wronged by the entire universe (…) the heart cries over the injustice you experienced/ May God have mercy on you and your family Goodbye to Uncle Abu Tariq, Umm Tariq, and the rest of the family / Patience for Tamer if he is still alive” Al-Mezan Center for Human Rights recorded Tamer al-Nabahin’s eyewitness testimony. Tamer, Attiya’s brother, told Al-Mezan that he survived the bombing alongside his pregnant wife, and that the house was bombed at a time when his three children were playing with their cousins in the entrance to the house – all of whom were killed.The Kid’s Palace Kindergarten school posted a tribute to Tamer’s children: 5 year old student Rayan Tamer Fathi Attiya al-Nabahin, his brother 7 year old Kenan Tamer Fathi Attiya al-Nabahin who was a former student, and 2 year old Maryam Tamer Fathi Attiya al-Nabahin, their younger sister. They also mourned the death of the mother of “Fathi Al-Nabahin” without providing her name or age.

We all went down to check on my father and mother, who live on the ground floor and whose door opens directly onto the mosque. As you can see, we could not enter from here, so we went from the back and made holes in the walls, and we began removing the rubble until we reached my father and mother and some of the children, grandchildren, who were stuck under the stones that fell on them from the mosque.” Bilal Salama’s father and mother were taken to the hospital for treatment of their injuries.Felesteen News spoke to another witness named Hajj Jihad Jarour whose bulldozer, which is how he made his livelihood, was destroyed by the bombing: “We were sitting in the basement of the house, and suddenly we heard the bombing and the house shook and smoke filled the place.

Al Mezan reported the death toll as four civilians killed, including two children and a woman.The four victims killed have been identified by all sources as a family; the mother Shuruq al-Naqla (30 years old), her husband Mohammed al-Naqla (31 years old) and their two sons, Omar al-Naqla (three or four years old) and Yousef al-Naqla (five or six years old). On Facebook Bassem al- Naqla, Shuruq’s brother, reported that Mariam, their third child, was also killed in the attack. However, Amnesty International reported that their two year – old daughter Mariam and their three-year old nephew Abdel Karim were injured and were taken to hospital whereupon they were quickly released due to overcrowding. Around 20 others were also reportedly injured in the attack.Ismail al-Naqla, Mohammed’s brother, told Amnesty International that their next-door neighbor received a warning call from the Israeli military around 10:30am so Ismail and Mohammad and their families left the home. However, since the bombing hadn’t occurred by 3:30pm, the al-Naqla family had quickly returned home to collect essential items when the bomb struck. They hoped it would be safe to return home as 5 hours had elapsed without a bomb since their neighbors received the call to evacuate earlier that morning. Ismail described to Amnesty “seeing part of his five-year-old nephew Yousef’s brain “outside of his head” and said that three-year-old Omar’s body could not be recovered from under the rubble until the next day.”Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Where possible, Airwars has matched names and ages with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26th.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

On October 11th 2023, relatives reported his death on social media. The precise details of the incident and Khaled’s death are not yet known – and no sources identified the possible perpetrator.Family members and friends identified the victim on social media in posts that expressed uncertainty about Khaled’s condition. Two days after the incident took place Facebook user Ahmad Rami Kahil wrote an urgent appeal to philanthropists to garner their support to help save Khaled who, he suggested, may still have been alive beneath the rubble. In a photo Khaled is depicted on the seafront as a smiling young man, wearing a white and grey hoodie. The comment read ‘The young man Khaled Ramez Abu Kwaik has been under the rubble since Monday in Al-Dahdouh Building, next to Al-Azhar University, Faculty of Medicine, third floor, and we do not know whether he was martyred or living under the rubble. We want the Civil Defense to take him out (his mother’s situation is very difficult, and she is waiting for someone to reassure her about him)’.In a Facebook post, user Saqir Rajab also expressed uncertainty about his friend’s condition. He wrote, “Your prayers for the beloved, childhood friend Khaled Ramez Abu Kwaik. May God return him to his family and loved ones. He is now under rubble as a result of the targeting of the Tal al-Hawa towers the day before yesterday, and until this moment his fate is not known and it is difficult to reach him.”Family members and friends later expressed their grief and heartache on social media, in posts that confirmed Khaled’s death. Friend Abu Aleid Khwiter shared a photo of Khaled smiling toward the camera with food in one hand. The image had a comment that read, “The martyrdom of the young man and good neighbor Khaled Ramez Abu Kwaik. May God have mercy on you, beloved.

According to publicly available information, a combatant Hilal was killed alongside at least 24 identified civilians, including at least 13 women (among them a pregnant woman) and four children. At least 40 civilians were reportedly wounded.Following this event, AFP news agency made available a photograph that purportedly showed the destruction caused by the alleged bombing, captioned “Members of the Palestinian Abu Hilal family inspect the damage inside their home following overnight Israeli air strikes on Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, on October 9, 2023.”Members of five families, including Abu Hilal, Barhoum, Zanoun and Labad families, were among the victims of the strike. Their family members wrote Facebook testimonies shedding some light on the identities of the victims of the deadly attack.According to a report by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, the strike occurred at approximately 01:20 and led to the complete destruction of the Abu Hilal house and damaged several houses adjacent to it. It led to the death of 19 civilians, including nine women and four children, and the injury of 40 others. A post from Adel Zarab reported that “more than 80 injuries” resulted from attacks in Rafah but it is unclear if they all occurred during this incident. News agencies Associated Press and Anadolu Agency also reported that 19 civilians were killed, citing a doctor Talat Barhoum at the nearby Al-Najjar Hospital. However, Twitter account @khalil3 reported about 25 killed civilians in the Abu Hilal family house. Airwars identified the names of 24 civilians killed and the identity of up to 36 total victims killed.The Abu Hilal family posted pictures of the funerals of the family members and the prayer in mosques on Facebook. One body, presumably of Raafat though it was covered, was draped in a flag of a militant organisation with a gun and the word resistance (مقاومة) on it – a word used often by militant groups in Gaza. The Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades are the militant wing of the Popular Resistance Committees – a loose grouping of armed factions in Gaza.The Abu Hilal family posted about the late 31-year old Yahya Khalid Harb Abu Hilal, his wife, their son and their daughter (whose names were not published) as well as Abu Saqr Abu Hilal, his wife Sabreen Hussein Abu Hilal (30), and their children (whose names were not published), and Rana Khaled Abu Hilal, a wife of Abd Raafat who was not killed in the attack. A Facebook post by NööÑöö Àĺì mentions some other victims of this attack from the Abu Hilal family, namely, Muhammad Raafat Abu Hilal, Suha Abu Hilal (Abu Arab) and her two daughters (whose names were not published), a 28-year old pregnant Nada Khaled Abu Hilal, Abdul Karim Abu Hilal (70) and his wife Rasmiya Abu Hilal (70), and Nisreen Yahya Abu Hilal (6, possibly a child of Yahya).In a Facebook post Ahmad Sami Barhom wrote that Ayman Sabri Barhoum who was not killed in the strike lost his 61-year old mother Sabah Muhammad Ahmad Barhoum, his 20-year old sister Nibal (Nepal) Sabri Barhoum, his 24-year old wife Asmaa Bassam Mohammad Barhoum and their 2-year old son Abdul Rahman Ayman Sabri Barhoum in the “brutal bombing of Rafah.” A nephew of Asmaa Bassam Mohammad Barhoum, Talat Barhoum, also mourned the death of the Barhoum family members in a Facebook testimony. A list provided by Najia Mahmoud included “Alaa Barhoum’s mother” but it is unclear if she is one of the people mentioned above.A Labad family member Umm Ibrahim Labad and her grandson, the child Saad Mahmoud Labad (2) were also killed in the strike and remembered by Umm Ibrahim Labad’s nephew, Mohammed Atalla, in a Facebook post. Nabila Suleiman Labad (60) was also mentioned as a victim in a Facebook post by Diwan Al-Areesh – this may be Umm Ibrahim Labad but it is unclear from the sources.According to the post by Abu Kamal Zanoun, six members of the Zanoun family lost their lives in the attack, namely, Hajj Zaki Nassar Zanoun Abu Khaled (70), his wife Badriya Zanoun Barhoum (71), his nephew Nassar Salim Zanoun Abu Salim (35), his relatives Ahmed Azmi Zanoun (16), and Soha Azmi Zanoun (18). The late Hajj Zaki Nassar Zanoun Abu Khaled and his wife were mentioned as neigbours of Abu Hilal in the post by Saqie Hilal. A post from Jehad Zanoon included an image of Nassar “honouring his cousin” Soha, and both can be seen holding an award. According to Raed Hasan Zanoon, the funeral for the members of the Zanoun family took place at Ebad Al-Rahman Mosque and they were buried at the Eastern Cemetery.The tweet from @vivapalestineee included additional names killed in “the bombing of the Abu Hilal family home”: Shadia Saleh Marjouna (46), Marzouqa Freih Abu Jazar (92), and Bilal Saeed Abu Jazar (30), in addition to an unknown woman and the unknown remains of two people from the Dhair family.

Wafa news reports that the Grand Mosque, which is one of the most important landmarks in the city of Khan Yunis, was attacked with several missiles, wounding a number of passers-by.While there are no names of victims available within the sources, Shehab Agency, Ahram News, and Safa all reported that the strike had caused at least several injuries, while some sources (Abbad news) spoke about many injured civilians. Only one source, a tweet by @Mohamedmuhanna9, reported about the allegedly killed civilians: “The Grand Mosque in central Khan Yunis was targeted, and there were a number of injuries and martyrs at the scene”. As no clear number was provided regarding the number of civilians wounded, Airwars ranged the number of injured to be between two and ten based on an aggregation of multiple references to many injured civilians.Multiple sources, including Abadd News, a Facebook user Albader, and 26 September Net, all alleged that Israeli forces intended to hit the mosque, while Shehab Agency and Najah TV alleged the strike was aimed at a house nearby the mosque. All sources claim the strike hit a civilian area within Gaza.The exact time of the incident and further details about the victims are unknown. Airwars recorded a civilian harm incident the same day resulting in the deaths of at least several civilians and in the destruction of the old municipality building of Khan Yunis, which is adjacent to the Grand Mosque. As at least one source mentioned “several strikes”, this incident has been coded separately as ISP0045. Given the proximity of the locations of both incidents, and the lack of details regarding the victims of ISPT0060, it is possible that some of the casualty figures tracked here overlap.

One other son, Elias Ibrahim Abu Shamala, was mentioned in a Facebook post by his uncle as being in serious condition while one of the family’s neighbours posted that all four children were killed.

Mosab Abo Taha announced on Facebook that his cousin, described as a pregnant woman, was also killed in the bombing of the mosque.The civilians injured were transferred to Al-Shifa Hospital, according to local reports. An unknown number of children who were carrying water were reported missing, so the number of victims could be higher than initially reported. As their whereabouts remain unknown, Airwars did not include this information in its casualty ranges yet.The UK Independent wrote that the “entire neighbourhood” around the Al-Sousi mosque was razed to the ground by the attack. The same source indicated that three other mosques were hit by alleged Israeli bombing in the area the same day. The strikes reportedly killed “dozens of Palestinians in the camp”. The civilian harm allegation linked to the strikes hitting three mosques (Ahmed Yassin mosque, Al-Gharbi mosque and Yarmouk Mosque) was tracked separately by Airwars, with the following code: ISPT0054.The Independent published images showing survivors “clambering over rubble and piling bodies onto stretchers”. Hasan Isleeh additionally reported that dozens of homes were destroyed in the attack.According to the Palestinian Ministry of Interior, there was no warning ahead of the strike.The names of eight of those killed and two who were wounded have been identified within local sources:61-year old Musa Ismail Matar (“Abu Ismail”) was killed in the strike according to the Facebook testimony of his wife’s brother. The Board of Directors of the Ashkelon People’s Association expressed its sincere condolences to the Musa’s family.

The source added that specialised teams continued to search for the remaining members of the family under the rubble of their home.Sources on the ground told correspondents for the Palestinian News Agency ‘Wafa’ that the brothers’ father Akram Musa Al-Madhoun, their mother and two brothers were killed by an alleged Israeli bombing of the neigbouring house during the 2021 Israeli campaign in the Gaza Strip. However, their relative Douha Madhoon wrote on Facebook that in fact their father, their younger brother Abdullah, and Muhammad’s first wife were killed at that time, while their mother had died of cancer years ago.The deaths of so many members of the al-Madhoun family was reported on by relatives across the globe. In Australia, a family relative Hadeel al-Madhoun spoke to the Sydney Morning Herald to tell the story of her father learning of the loss of life of at least 14 family members through an Al Jazeera report. “A 78-year old Mousa al-Madhoun was sitting in the loungeroom of his Mickleham home, in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, watching Al Jazeera, when a reporter announced an Israeli missile had destroyed the Al-Madhoun family compound in Beit Lahia, an area in the northern part of the territory, killing 14 people. He dropped the cup of coffee he was holding, stared at the screen and started crying”, she told Sydney Morning Herald.. The brothers who owned the house were Mousa’s cousins. Hadeel Al-Madhoun told the Australian reporters that she had lost at least 33 family members in Gaza since the Israeli bombardment began. “I don’t think the world is really seeing what is happening,” she added.A Palestinian American Hani Almadhoun who lives in Virginia learned Monday morning from a Telegram chat that an Israeli airstrike killed at least 14 members of his family, including five children and elderly relatives. “Death comes very fast,” Almadhoun told HuffPost. “We don’t get any solidarity.” Before he hadn’t been able to reach his family in Gaza for the last four days.Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

The Palestine Center for Human Rights (PCHR) and Defence for Children International-Palestine (DCI) reported that the strike occurred without warning at approximately 3 am.The Palestinian Center for Human Rights reported that the strike completely destroyed the four floors of the home, killing all 13 civilians within it, including four women and five children. Additional social and local media sources indicated that the death toll was 15 civilians, including 6 children. The dead identified were the elderly Musa Samir Musa al-Qatnani (Abu Samir, 64), his wife Umm Samir al-Shalabi, their children, Samir, Omar and Hamada al-Qatnani, Rana Nasser al-Shalab (Samir al-Qatnani’s wife), Aseel al-Qatnani, and Maha al-Qatnani. Relatives posted generally that Abu Samir and Umm Samir, their three children, each of their wives, and their grandchildren were killed. Defense for Children International and The Guardian revealed the names of five of the children killed – siblings Basma (16), Mohammad (13), and Sally Samir Mousa al-Qatnani (11), and their cousins Salma (4) and Jawan Omar Mousa al-Qatnani (2) (also reported as Joan), with DCI also noting the death of Ali Omar Mousa al-Qatnani (4). Rana al-Shalabi’s mother posted that her daughter Rana and Rana’s children were also killed. While the two other members of the family killed have not been named, it is not known where Rana and Samir’s daughter Aleem was at the time of the strike. Similarly, from social media, Salma’s father appears to be Muhammad Musa Al-Qatnani. It is unclear where he was at the time of the strike.According to the victim’s social media profiles, earlier this year Rana al-Shalab and her husband Samir celebrated both her graduation with a Bachelor’s Degree in General Nursing from the University College of Applied Sciences Gaza, as well as their daughter Aleem’s high school graduation. Muhammed Musa al-Qatnani celebrated his daughter’s first birthday a few days prior to the bombing. Relatives, friends and neighbours mourned the loss on social media, with posts such as “Beneath the ruins of this house, 15 martyrs from the Al-Qatnani family…an entire family removed from the civil registry”, “It is with great sadness that we received the news of the martyrdom of our family and relatives….the martyrdom of Abu Samir Al-Qatnani family and of our dear sister, Rana Nasser, and her husband and children under the Israeli bombing in Gaza…/We belong to God and to Him we shall return… Survival belongs to God/15 martyrs from the Qatnani family”, and another saying “Oh God, the amount of pain/There is sadness in our neighbourhood.”According to North Jersey News, Mohammad Qatanani, a relative of the family who is the Imam of the Islamic Center of Passaic County in New Jersey, learnt of the strike when he saw “images of his family members flashed on the screen of the Al Jazeera network.” He was quoted as saying “The whole family has been taken out…My uncle, his wife, three children, their wives and their children. In total 15. It’s not only my family. There are thousands of families we are losing every day. You can’t imagine the situation they are in right now.” An influential member of New Jersey’s religious communities who has spoken at various churches and synagogues across the state, he received condolences from state officials. It was reported that after his family fled Gaza in 1948, he has not been able to return due to the blockade imposed by the Israeli government on the Gaza Strip; he has therefore not seen the family in Gaza for decades, and they have likewise been unable to leave.Maha al-Qatnani, whose husband and children were also killed, is survived by her brother Karama Ghunaim, who mourned her saying “….With souls satisfied with God’s judgement and destiny, we received the news of the martyrdom of my sister Maha, her husband, children and all those who were with her…/We ask the Almighty to surround them with His vast mercy and to dwell them in a spacious manner/We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return”.Airwars was unable to match any of the named victims to the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

However Defense for Children International Palestine (DCIP), who named Nahida’s children, noted that the bombing took place on the morning of October 10th in their report. There may have been some delay in the accounts, given that the civilians could not initially be found in the rubble, with a family member, Ahmad Sardah, reporting that the victims were trapped under the rubble for 12 hours.While DCIP reported that only four civilians were killed, including three children and that other children were injured in the alleged airstrike, family members identified the names of six victims killed. Yasir Serdah, a family member, reported that there were others wounded but did not say how many. Airwars recorded six civilians killed, and two to three civilians injured, including at least two children in the attack.The six victims were identified by their relatives as the grandmother, Nahida Ramadan Sardah (Umm Mousa al-Hassi) and her daughters-in-law, Rania Mohammed Hassan (Mousa Al-Hassi’s wife) and Rima Nassar.

The posts noted that prior to this attack, they were fleeing from the east of the Khan Yunis district, with one source adding that 50 others were injured.Social media posts about funerals identified the four men referenced above. A Facebook post by Sharif Shurrab is the only post to mention a fifth casualty. Based on a report by Reuters, it is likely that this death is that of a 4 year old girl named Shahib Abu Rokbah. She was also reported to be fleeing with her family from the east of Khan Yunis district when she was killed. The report by Reuters includes testimony from a volunteer who noted that “they tried to escape death only to find it… They came to find shelter. They were taking refuge next to the stairs where it could have been a safe place. They targeted them and killed them.”Though two social media posts and @ShehabAgency reported that people were wounded in this incident, no consistent figures were provided. Sharif Shurrab’s post was the only source which noted the number of wounded at 50.Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Airwars recorded a civilian harm incident the same day resulting in reported civilian harm in an area close to the Grand Mosque, which is adjacent to the old municipality building.

Multiple sources, including the Palestinian Center for Human Rights and Al Mezan, reported that the strike took place without prior warning and resulted in the complete destruction of the home.Several social media posts from family members confirmed the death of Faisal and Nour, offering words of grief for their lost loved ones. “Make your abode in paradise,” reads a post from Iman Qishta. “Oh heartache.” Several family members shared photos of Faisal. In one he is wearing a blue shirt that says “positive”, and another he is shown posing in front of a ferris wheel. “May God have mercy on you, my uncle Abu Muhammad,” reads a social media post from Mohsen Qishta. “May God have mercy on you, my cousin. Oh God, replace them with a better home than their home.”Other photos shared by family members and the Qishta family Facebook page appear to show the aftermath of the strike, with rescue workers looking through the wreckage of the heavily damaged home and taking what appear to be bodies covered in blankets or sheets to an ambulance.Early accounts of the strike from PBC News and a social media post from the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that 12 people were injured in the strike, and the Shehab Agency posted an image of a young girl being treated by medical professionals, with a caption stating that she was injured in the bombing of the Qishta family home in Rafah.Later accounts from the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) and Al Mezan both stated that 14 people were injured.The names of both Nour Qishta and Faisal have been found in the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The location was described by sources as the Qishta neighbourhood of Rafah, likely because the family was known in the area.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

Amnesty International reported that the strike completely destroyed the building and killed at least forty civilians.Social media testimonies helped to identify some of the victims of the attack.

However, some other sources like Mohammad Ahmad and Omm Ibraheem mentioned that five children of Iman were killed, so the fifth unnamed child may be also among the victims.

But I couldn’t protect them, I have no trace left of my daughter. I’m talking to you now as I’m trying to remove the rubble with my hands. We cannot even count our dead.” Ahmad Ashour added that in addition to those killed, “two days after their house was bombed, my cousin emerged from under the rubble alive” – it is unclear who this is referring to.In addition, Fawzi Naffar (61) said that 19 of his family members were killed in the strike, including his wife, children, and grandchildren.

More than a month later, on November 30, 2023, a Twitter/X user Magda Gad wrote that “ten people were killed in the attack on the building, including three journalists, referring to the testimony of Bilal Abu Hatzira who rescued bodies from the ruins that night.Muhammad Haboush posted the names of five victims of the attack belonging to three different families on Facebook, adding that “with hearts that believe in God’s will and destiny, I extend my deepest condolences and sympathy to my neighbors.” Islam Mahfouz Khalaf, 42, was killed together with his younger brother Muhammed Mahfouz Khalaf, 28. Ibrahim, the father-in-law of the late Islam, revealed that Islam was survived by his pregnant wife Rola, their daughter Taghreed and son Majd, posting on social media: “I searched among the vocabulary for words to say to my pregnant daughter, Rola, and her eldest daughter, Taghreed, and to her son, Majd, Sons of Islam, but I lost the vocabulary.. I lost the words.. I lost the letters.. I was trapped. Tears fell.”Majdy Anan wrote in a Facebook testimony: “My cousin’s children were martyred today, Islam Khalaf and Muhammad Khalaf”, sharing the images of the two young men, one in a brown jacket and other in a Palestinian scarf. Raed M Khalaf also paid a tribute to the two deceased brothers who were his cousins.Among the victims killed in the attack were Brigadier General Hani Issa Hasouna (Abu Hassam) and his nephew, an engineer Shadi Suhail Hassouna. The Haboush Family shared a testimony on Facebook, extending “deepest condolences and sympathy to the honorable Hassouna family on the martyrdom of their sons”.Hani Issa Hasouna was remembered in Facebook posts by his nephew Nemer Alrubaei and by his friend Abdul Qadir Idris. The latter shared an image of a grey-haired man in glasses standing in front of microphones. Abu Qadir Idris also shared in his post that Hani Hassouna was a member of the Prisoner’s Committee of the National and Islamic forces, and a Leader of the Popular Front General Command. Based on this information Airwars identified the late Hani Issa Hasouna as a militant.Hani’s nephew, engineer Shadi Suhail Hassouna appeared in the images as a smiling middle-aged man in front of the mosque. According to Ali Rezeq Nijim, Hani’s son Hossam Hassouna was injured in the bombing. A Facebook post from Yahya Al Sayed identified his father as one of the injured, “after he was hit with shrapnel in the shoulder”.One more victim of the attack was a young 27 year old man, Raafat al-Hato. His death was also mourned on social media, with his brother and friend Mohammed Abo Qass sharing that Raafat “had a beautiful smile and a kind heart.” Indeed the late Raafat appears on the images as a smiling athletic bearded man.

Alhurra News reported that the three journalists were standing dozens of meters away from the building, to cover an expected Israeli airstrike on a residential building. It was reported that one of the residents had received a phone call from the Israeli army requesting its evacuation in preparation for its destruction, but according to journalists who witnessed the incident, Israeli warplanes struck the building where the journalists stopped to document the bombing.Many local sources reported that the three journalists had been killed, but a few sources were initially conflicted if two were still in intensive care. @ehajjar and Journalist Khaled Al Qadi stated that journalist Hisham Al-Nawajeh was seriously injured and “still in the operating room”, and @Shehab Agency tweeted a statement from the Government Media office in Gaza, “we mourn the two fellow journalists, Muhammad Sobh and Saeed Al- Taweel, who were killed as a result of being targeted by [Israeli] aircraft while covering the evacuation of one of the buildings threatened by bombing in western Gaza, and we wish recovery to our colleague Hisham Al-Nawajah, who was with them and who is currently receiving treatment”. Whereas Hadeel El Tibi reported that journalist Saeed Al-Taweel was injured and “the news is conflicting between his martyrdom and that he is still in intensive care”. However, images were later posted of the funeral for Saeed and the Ministry of Health recorded Hisham’s death.Saleem Hosny reported that while residents in the area were warned of a bombing on Burj Hajji, the bombing of the Babel building in the same street came without warning, “in a surprise move.” Facebook user Rushdi Aleeb wrote in a post that the Babel building was “razed to the ground”, sharing the pain of his loss: “My house, my life, and my money were completely destroyed.” He shared apocalyptic pictures and a video of the rubble left from what used to be the Babel building.Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.

And my beloved children, we were like friends: Hamza, Jinan, Asil, Abdul Rahman, Bader Al-Din, and Basheer Al-Maaswabi. By God, the eyes will shed tears and the heart will grieve.”Zakawa kitchen wrote a touching testimony on Facebook about Amal’s dreams and aspirations to study. “She got married at an early age, and her dream was to go to school. She gave birth to six children, and that only increased her insistence on studying until God granted her the grace to sit the high school exams with her eldest son, Hamzah, and obtain an average of 78%. But she was not able to share the joy of achieving the dream, as yesterday she became a martyr… It was as if she was saying to the world: I will not leave without my children.”Relatives of Amal Al-Naffar also reportedly killed consisted of Ibrahim Al Naffar, his wife, their son Khalil Al Naffar and their daughter.

Most people killed were from the Al-Sawaleh (Al-Sawalha) family.Numerous sources listed the names of those who were killed and put the death toll at 19 people. Some sources cited a range between 12 and 17 while noting the fact that these were preliminary figures and people were still being rescued from under the rubble and that therefore, the death toll was likely to increase.Local sources cited “dozens” of civilians as injured without specifying a number.Furthermore, posts by various eyewitnesses stated that: “Ezbet Abd Rabbo, east of Jabalia, is being subjected to very violent bombardment these moments” and another post stated that “most of the estate’s dwellings” were destroyed.

Quds Press reported that three people had been killed, as did another X / Twitter user: @ESAL1113788. Sputnik Arabic stated on its website that the Palestinian News Agency had reported that “on Wednesday morning, Israeli warplanes targeted a house belonging to the Al-Naqib family in the Nuseirat camp without warning and levelled it to the ground resulting in a large number of deaths and injuries”.Over the course of the 11th, family members and friends of the civilians killed in the attack confirmed that the strike had taken place, and began to post lists of the names of those who had died, via Facebook. The individuals who posted lists of the civilians killed included: Abdel Fattah Naqib, Abou Al-Baraa, Ibrahim Qedama, Hany Qedama and Abdul M.

According to the Facebook account “Made in Gaza”, some people were also missing following the attack.A 31-year old man Al-Mahfez/Khaled Akram Ahmad al-Sarhi (“Abu Al-Walid”) who was referred to as “Professor” in the post by Ahmad Mazen was killed in the strike. He was survived by his baby son Walid Khaled Al-Sarhi. His death was mourned by Mustafa Mahmoud who posted a picture of a smiling man and wrote “God Almighty: “And do not think that those who were killed in the cause of God are dead; rather, they are alive with their Lord, being provided for.” In a Facebook testimony by Khamis Sadi Al-Samouni the late Khaled Akram Ahmad al-Sarhi was portrayed in a suit at some festive event. His friend Abdulsalam Aldaloul referred to him as a “Governor” and wrote the words full of grief: “The eyes shed tears and the heart grieves, and we are saddened by your departure, Abu Al-Walid”. The late Khaled is featured in the attached image with a young boy, probably his son.A post by Facebook user Atef Naimi shows a photo of a woman holding a baby with a red sweater and a wisp of brown hair next to a row of what appear to be white body bags. “Walid Khaled Al-Sarhi is carried by his grandmother,” the caption reads, ”not knowing that his father [likely Khaled Akram Al-Sarhi, identified as Abu Walid, or ‘father of Walid’] is among the bodies of the martyrs of the Zaytoun neighborhood.”A 46-year old Mahmoud Akram Al-Sarhi also lost his life in the strike according to the Facebook testimony of his cousin Ahmad Mazen. Among the victims were also Ahmad Mazen’s sister’s husband Hossam Zuhair Al-Ghoula (Abu Anas), his 24-year old friend Abdul (Abdel) Karim Asaad Abu Samra (Abu Al-Joud), and Al-Qamar Khalil Abu Samra (Khalil Hani), son of Al-Siddiq Hani Abu Samra. Abdul Karim Asaad Abu Samra’s smiling picture was shared in a Facebok testimony by Hay alZaytoun. Facebook user Ashraf Al-Nimr, who calls Khalil Hani Abu Samra the son of his cousin, posted a picture showing him wearing sunglasses and smiling as he dangles his legs into a pool. His picture was also shared in a Facebook post by Adham Alnimir.A 37-year old man Bakir Al-Sarhi (Abu Assem) was reportedly killed together with his wife, seemingly 30-year old Abeer Akram Hussein al-Sirhi (possibly also called Abeer Akram Akkila), their children, his father, mother and siblings. Haroun Daloul mourned the loss of Bakr Al-Sarhi. “The eyes shed tears and the heart grieves, and we are saddened by your departure,” Daloul wrote of his friend. He also posted a picture of the smiling Bakir amidst olive fields. Abeer Akram Akkila was remembered in Facebook testimony by Akkila family.Among the victims was also another man, Saker (Saqr) Al-Sarhi, who was reportedly killed together with his wife, his children, his brothers, his brothers’ wives and their children, his mother and his son. Fadi Mustafa Farwana wrote in a touching testimony that Saker lost all his family members.The deadly attack also took the lives of young children. A daughter of the Al-Sarhi neigbors, an 11-year old girl Janna Zuhair ‘Ata Madi was remembered in a Facebook post by Hay Alzaytoun, showing her as a young girl with brown hair and a pink shirt. A 15-year old Mervat Saleh Fahmy Al-Sarhi was also among the killed children, remembered by her mother in a Facebook testimony.A man named Mahmoud Hasballah reported that his brother Abu Ramzi was injured in the bombing. His Facebook post included a photo of a mid-aged man on a stretcher with bandages on his arm and leg in what appears to be a medical facility.This is the only positively identified case of an injury in the strike, but the Facebook account “Made in Gaza” notes “martyrs, injuries and missing persons” from the strike on the al-Sarhi home. Due to the plural use of “injuries” the number of maximum injured civilians has been increased to two.Testimonies by the family members and friends of the Al-Sarhi family speak about many victims, paying tribute to one specific person but adding that his/her relatives were also killed. It is therefore possible that the number of the civilians killed in the strike may exceed the eleven identified victims. Airwars will update the death toll figures if new information emerges.Photos of the aftermath of the attack posted by Nedal Abu Hasan and Camera Press on Facebook show very extensive damage in the area around the strike, including a collapsed home, rubble, and overturned vehicles.

The owner of the house, Omar Abu Shab Abu Rifaat, was severely injured and remained in intensive care as of the 11th October.

Other victims included 23-year old Alaa Omar Suleiman Abu Shab (Shabab), as well as the wife of Rifaat Omar Salman Abu Shab (her name was not indicated in testimonies), and her children, a one-year old son Amir Rifaat Omar Salman Abu Shab (Shabab) and a three-year old girl Nagham Refaat Omar Salman Abu Shab (Shabab). Mahmoud Abu Rahma posted pictures of these two small children who lost their lives in the attack on Facebook.The victims’ relatives and friends – Fadi Abu Khater, Om Fathi Abu Shab, Dahir ABu Shab, and Mamhmoud Saqr mourned the death of their loved ones in the testimonies on Facebook. Rakab family expressed its deepest condolensces to its neighbours, Abu Shab family.Describing the attack on the two family houses (Abu Shab and Al-Agha, the latter described in another incident – ISPT0124), the Shehab Agency correspondent wrote about up to 15 injured civilians, but later the Wafa agency reported about “injury of dozens”.Airwars recorded the identified victims members of Al-Agha family in another incident, coded as ISPT0124.

Four people were reported injured in this airstrike that occurred without prior warning, causing two buildings to collapse, according to local sources.At least one victim was reported to be a militant, a leader in the Islamic Jihad group, Musa Naseer.Facebook user Ahmad Nasseir identified seven victims as: his uncle Hajj Mahdi Ali Naseer (Abu Muhammad), his uncle’s son Ibrahim Mahdi Ali Naseer, his aunt’s husband Ahmed Eid Naseer Abu Haitham and his cousins Musa Ahmed Eid Naseer, Haitham Ahmed Eid Naseer, Ahmed Haitham Naseer and Taher Arif Naseer.Another relative, Reem Tanboura, extended his ‘deepest condolences and consolation’ to the Naseer family in a Facebook post. He announced the death of four victims: ‘My uncle Ahmed Mohamed Naseer and my cousin martyr Moses Ahmed Naseer. And my cousin the martyr Haitham Ahmed Naseer, and his young son Ahmed Haitham Naseer”. Therefore from this testimony Airwars has quantified Ahmed Haitham Naseer as a child.A Facebook user Ramez Salem also mourned the death of the Naseer Family, who he described as ‘a good family with established origins and branches in the highest paradise.’Nabd News reported that Islamic Jihad leader Musa Naseer was killed in his house in Beit Lahia. A number of sources, including Al-Qastal News newspaper, Fox news, and Nabd News reported that Naseer was an Islamic Jihad leader.The civilian status for three of the victims remains ambiguous. Haitham Ahmed Eid Naseer, Ibrahim Mahdi Ali Naseeir and Taher Arif Naseer were referred to by one source, Ahmed Nasseir, as either “mujahid” or “leader/commander”.

The incident was also reported on by Al Mezan, with Shankit TV also reporting that “the occupation targeted with its warplanes a house in the camp area west of Khan Yunis, and medical sources reported that about 12 martyrs and dozens of wounded were reported.” As it is not clear from this source whether these 12 civilians were killed in this house or in another house given the intensity of bombardment, and there was little other confirmation of the higher fatality estimate, this figure has only been included in Airwars’ upper casualty range.Only one source identified the belligerent as the Israeli military, therefore Airwars qualified the strike status as “single source claim”.

Anadolu Agency reported that eyewitnesses said strike left the house in complete ruins and inflicted damage to nearby buildings.Initially Shehab News reported five casualties and “a number” of injured civilians.

Local sources reported that the building contained 12 residential apartments and housed approximately 70 people, including displaced people from the border areas.The number of casualties was initially reported at 17 but rose to 26 with news sources such as Jo24.net reporting that many were trapped under the rubble. Adham Abu Selmia (@adham922) shared an emotional video on the Twitter/X social media platform showing the immediate aftermath of the tragedy and people looking for survivors under the rubble at night. Huda Naim (@HuDa_NaIm92) shared another video on Twitter/X showing young men attempting to rescue a screaming child trapped under the rubble.The injured civilians were transferred to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the neighboring city of Deir al-Balah. Wafa.ps reported that the morgues in Al-Aqsa Hospital were “filled with bodies from the attack”, with tents being set up outside for the increasing casualties. The list of casualties has been compiled from various social media posts, obituaries, and news agencies.The biggest losses suffered were the Al-Nabahin family. A relative of the family, Ahmad Al-Nabahin, mentioned in a Facebook post 17 names of the members of the Al-Nabahin and Abu Madin families who were killed, sharing some of their pictures.Another family member, Hadi Khalid, mourned in her Facebook testimony the death of the 20 members of the Al-Nabahin family, including, in particular, her 56-year-old father Khaled Muhammad Al-Nabahin, her sister and Khaled’s daughter, a 28-year-old Dalia Khaled Muhammad Al-Nabahin, the wife of her uncle Musa, a 62-year-old Intisar Abdel Latif Mohamed Al-Nabahin Abd al-Jawad with her sons, Hadi Khalid’s cousins – a 31-year-old Yousef Musa Al-Nabahin, a 27-year-old Bassem Saeed Al-Nabahin and a 36-year-old Muhammad Musa Al-Nabahin. The images of Bassem and Yousef can be seen in the Facebook post by Ahed Alkhaldi.Bassem Saeed was among the victims of the deadly strike. He was reported to be a basketball player for the Khadamat al-Bureji team. His death was mourned in an obituary by the Palestinian Basketball Federation where he was pictured in a basketball shirt with the number 5. The Palestine Olympic Committee also dedicated a Facebook post to the deceased sportsman, writing that he had previously won the Basketball League title in the southern governorates, while also sharing a picture of him with a ball.Daabes Mohammad wrote a heartfelt Facebook testimony dedicated to the late Yousef Musa Al-Nabahin: “My companion, my brother, and my beloved. May God give me the patience to leave you. Yesterday you were with me and gave me water to drink, and today you are a martyr.” A smiling Yousef is seen with the author of the post in the attached image.Hadi Khalid further mentioned 37-year-old Asma Mousa Al-Nabahin who was killed together with her husband, 43-year-old Professor Muhammad Suleiman Al-Nabahin (Abu Suleiman), their three daughters – Jamila Muhammad Al-Nabahin, 16-year-old Raghad Muhammad Al-Nabahin and 12-year-old Rula Suleiman Al-Nabahin, and their 4-year-old son Ayoub Suleiman Al-Nabahin.University professor Muhammad Suleiman Al-Nabahin (Abu Suleiman) was remembered by his colleagues and friends in their obituaries. Ayman Al-Awawdeh wrote a heartfelt Facebook testimony dedicated to Abu Suleiman: “You were always loved in your work and in your home.” Waseem Abu Sara shared an image of Abu Suleiman sitting in a university auditorium with his colleague. Ibraheem Abu Shamale remembered him as “the friendly brother, fun and polite friend and colleague.”Hadi Khalid’s testimony also includes the names of the related Abu Madin family members, in particular, her 38-year-old cousin Maysaa Musa Al-Nabahin, her cousin’s husband, Sufyan Fareej Abu Madin, and their children: two sons – 16-year-old Muhammad Sufyan Abu Madin and seven-year-old Karam Sufyan Abu Madin and two daughters – 18-year-old Maryam Sufyan Abu Madin and Yara Sufyan Abu Madin.Hadi Khalid also mentioned a 38-year-old woman named Wissam Musa Mohammad Abu Dariqah and her one-year-old son Ghaith Iyad Abu Dariqah among the victims.The deadly bombing also took the lives of the six members of the Huwaishil family, including 38-year-old Saeed Jaber Salman Abu Huwaishil (Abu Al-Abd), his wife Samah Ismail Al Mashukhi (age unknown), and their three daughters – a three-year-old Sarah Saeed Abu Huwaishil, seven-year-old Sila Abu Huwaishil, nine-year-old Alma Abu Huwaishil and their son, 12-year-old Abdul Rahman Abu Huwaishil. The only surviving son was Moaz, according to journalist Adel Zourob and a friend of the late Samah, Sahar Alghoty. Ahmed Salman posted a picture of Saeed Abu Huwaishil’s children.Saeed Abu Huwaishil was remembered in the Facebook testimonies by his friend Ahmad Ahmad, and his cousins Abu Mohammad, Saree Mansour, and Ali Mansour. Ali Mansour noted that the late Saeed was his childhood friend. The friend of the late Saeed, Ramez Alqtrawi, wrote a touching post on Facebook featuring the wide-smiling Saeed and saying: “I promised you nothing but laughter, joy, the best brother, and the best friend. May God have mercy on you, my beloved Saeed Abu Huwaishil, and may God have mercy on all the martyrs”.A post by Mahmoud Fathy contained a picture of Saeed Abu Huwaishil in a military uniform, while Ahed Mahmoud showed him with a gun in his hands. However, there is no other evidence that Saeed was a militant, so Airwars has qualified his status as contested.The deceased daughter of Saeed, Sara Saeed Abu Huwaishil, was only three years old and was likely one of the youngest victims of this attack. Journalist Adel Zourob Official posted a heartbreaking image of Sara’s dead body covered with blood.Ramee Abu Ismail mentioned her sister, Umm Musa, was severely injured in the incident, but further details about her identity are unknown.The names of some victims have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023 while the names of some have been matched with the Ministry of Health list released on July 24, 2024.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.

Oh God, heal the brokenness of our hearts and make us patient with your judgement and destiny. O Lord, be with us and strengthen us increase our patience and reward us for our patience.

Iyad’s brother Nael al-Durra was also killed, along with his wife, Salwa Taha (al-Durra). Iyad’s wife and three sons, as yet unnamed, were uncovered from under the rubble and taken to the hospital with injuries, according to Eg News 24.Iyad and Nael’s brother Jamal al-Dourra told Anadolu Agency, “Israel bombed my brothers’ homes, killed my two brothers, my brother’s wife, and his only daughter.” Iyad and Nael’s brother Jamal stated to Elwatan News that the family had received no warning, and that he, his wife and children had survived solely due to a “divine miracle,” while also telling journalist Basma Wahba, presenter of the “90 Minutes” program, broadcast on the “Al-Mehwar” channel: “My house is located next to the house of my martyr brother, and on the day of his martyrdom I saw a tsunami in my house, and I left the house with my wife and children and we were injured.” He was only able to retrieve his brothers bodies from under rubble three days after the strike.Social media posts circulated of Jamal al-Dourra, brother to Nael and Iyad, praying for his family and paying tribute to his family members at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Mosque in the city of Deir al-Balah. In a video clip, Jamal is asking his brothers, “Reserve a place for me next to you,” as he prayed to God to help him with their passing.An image of Jamal al-Dourra and his late son Muhammad al-Dourra was reportedly an icon of an uprising in 2000, in which his young son was killed by Israeli fire. The image depicted Jamal and his son taking cover in a cement barrel while being fired upon. Sources have used both photos to report on the incident.A friend of Nael named Hussein Samir Kamel posted on Facebook a message to Nael that “You have been communicating with me for years about taking measures to buy an apartment for you in Egypt, but God wanted a better one for you in heaven with the martyrs.” A post on Twitter/X described Nael as “He used to help anyone in need, even beyond his capacity, and his wife Salwa was also beloved by everyone.”According to the Bureij Facebook age, the strike occurred in the square after the Martyrs’ Roundabout in Bureij Camp.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.

Ahmed Abu Jabara posted on Facebook that “All my family are martyrs, my brothers, their spouses, their children, and my wife and my children are martyrs…” Based on the names, it seems likely that Ahmed’s children who were killed are 5 year old Jihad Ahmed Abu Jabara and 3 year old Zaid Ahmed Abu Jabara, while Ahmed’s wife’s name was not found among the sources.A Facebook post from Abu Ihab Jabara referred to Waseem Abu Jabara as “The knight, my cousin and the apple of my eye”.Images posted by Al Khalil show three children being treated for their injuries in a hospital.A post from Ibrahim Al-Hajj identified the location of the strike as around the Martyrs’ Roundabout, adding that there was an appeal for first aid to arrive to help the victims.Safa PS reported that no warning was given prior to the strike.

A 37-year old Inshirah Ismail Musa Safi was killed in this deadly attack alongside her five children.Nabd news initially reported that “3 martyrs were recovered from the Safi family home”. Shehab Agency later stated that the number of civilians killed in the bombing had risen to six, with Qana24, Sawt al Watan News and RT News later updating the civilian death toll to nine, and multiple sources on social media corroborating the same. Based on the testimonies by family members, Airwars identified 14 family members of the Safi and Kaloub families who were killed.A 63-year-old Abdulkarim Hasan Safi was killed alongside his 62-year-old wife Lubna Abdulaziz Ahmad Safi and their possible grandchildren, an 18-year old girl Sondos Abdulkarim Hasan Safi, a 15-year-old boy Majdi Abdulkarim Hasan Safi, and a 9-year-old boy Zakariya Abdulkarim Hasan Safi. Salsabeel Abdulkraim Hasan Safi and Omar Abdulkarim Hasan Safi have been also listed as victims, but their age is unknown.A Facebook user Mohammed Al Zanin Abu Rafat mourned the death of a 29-year old man Younis Abdulkarimel Qader Safi and the rest of his family members. He shared the pictures of the young bearded man in a white T-shirt along with a graphic picture of the Younis’s lifeless body in a white cloth stained with blood. The brother-in-law of Younis, Anwar Zomlot, also mourned his death in a Facebook post, sharing a black and white picture of Younis.Toha Monir, possibly the wife of Younis, also posted a black and white image of her late husband and a prayer.Nisreen al-Silawi, a relative of the Safi family, mourned the death of her aunt, a 37-year old Inshirah Ismail Musa Safi, and Inshirah’s five children, among them three sons: an 18-year old Abdel Muti Hassan Abdulkarim Safi, a 15-year old Muhammad Hassan Abdulkarim Safi, and a 12-year old Ahmed Hassan Abdulkarim Safi, and two daughters: a 17-year old Afnan Hassan Abdulkarim Safi, and a 9-year old Tala Hassan Abdulkarim Safi. She also indicated that the family was survived by Inshirah’s husband Hassan Safi, saying “prayers for patience and solace for my uncle Hassan Safi on the loss of his family.” Nisreen also shared some images of Inshirah’s children killed in the strike, including an image of a young smiling boy in a Chanel T-shirt.Another relative, Mohammed Silawi, wrote in his Facebook post that his “sister and her children, the Safi family, are martyrs/May God have mercy on you, my beloved ones.” He attached an image of Insirah and Hassan and their five smiling children.Other sources on social media, Mohammed Kalloub and Abu Nedal, listed the names of four additional victims of the bombing belonging to Kaloub family – 48 year old Hayat Kaloub, Hayat’s daughters, a 17-year old Shatha Omar Saber Kaloub (Kulub) and Amal Kaloub, and Hayat’s grandson Muhammad Jadallah (age unknown). It is unclear whether they were relatives of the Safi family present in the home at the time of the bombing, as Mohammed Kalloub also mourned the “martyrs of my cousin Safi family.” They also shared the images of two women in black hijabs, among them one being Hayat Kaloub, and a young boy Muhammad pictured against the sea background.Where possible, Airwars has matched names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26th.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The incident occured at approximately 11:25 am local time., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed14(8–9 children4–5 women3 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed14(8–9 children4–5 women3 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed14(8–9 children4–5 women3 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Tagreed Dawwas, Nader Salah, Diya Dawas, and Ahmad Dawwas also posted their tributes on Facebook, sharing the images of the late Mounir.A relative Ramzi Dawwas mentioned the four named above who were killed along with other members of their family killed later, with the address Beit Lahia, entrance to Ezbet Dawas, west of Abbas Kilani roundabout, Al-Shaima Street. It is unclear if this address applies to this incident of another strike affecting the Dawas family.Airwars has matched the names of some of the civilians killed with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023, which explicitly mentions that names on the list are “victims of the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip”.

According to the Facebook tribute by Olifat Soleiman, a grandfather of the family, a 68-year old Juma Sirhan Khalil Abu Jazar was killed together with his five sons, their wives and his grandchildren.Quds news Twitter/X post showed the bodies covered with white cloth and at least two injured civilians in a hospital,and explained that this was a “new massacre… 10 Palestinians from the Abu Jazar family died”. A Twitter/X post by @Paldf also featured a video with the bodies of the people from the Abu Jazar family.Initially local sources reported about 6-10 killed civilians, but later the social media account of Abu Jazar family provided the names of the 14 identified victims, out of them at least 13 having a civilian status. Among them were the late Juma’s eldest son, a 38-year old Ahmed Abu Jazar together with his wife, a 25-year old Yousra Samir Abu Jazar. The late Juma’s other son, a 30-year old Rabie Juma Abu Jaza was killed with his 23-year old wife Islam Mahmoud Abu Jazar and their children – a 3-year old daughter Sham Rabie Abu Jazar and a 6-year old son Yamen Rabie Abu Jazar. The late Juma’s other son, a 32-year old Mahmoud Jumah Sirnan Abu Jazar lost his life together with his 32-year old wife Nariman Ismail Mahmoud Abu Jazar and apparently their children, an 8-year old daughter Ghalia Mahmoud Jumah Abu Jazar, a 4-year old son Abdul Salam Mahmoud Abu Jazar as well as Yemeni Mahmoud Abu Jazar and ٍRoya Mahmoud Abu Jazar, about whom there is no additional information.Among the victims were also an 18-year old Juma Anis Juma Abu Jazar and a 21-year old Ahmed Anis Juma Abu Jazar, apparently also the sons of Juma Sirhan Abu Jazar. They are portrayed as young men in elegant suits in the images attached to Olifat Soleiman’s post.The late family’s head Juma Sirhan Abu Jazar appears on an image attached to the Olifat Soleiman’s post as an elderly man with a moustache in a grey shirt and an embroidered vest. He used to have a Facebook account with 2,400 friends.Ahmed Abu Jazar is described in social media tributes as a freed prisoner who was released only a year ago after 19 (or 20, according to some sources) years of detention. Hassan Badawi wrote in his Facebook tribute: “The rise of the beloved brother, friend, and cellmate, Ahmed Abu Jazar”, and shared a photo of Abu Jazar in military uniform with a gun in his hand; meaning he may have been a militant in the past. Mohammed Kareem in his post referred to the late Ahmed as “freed captive cousin”. Zeko Abu Jazar wrote his testimony to the “freed prisoner” and shared an image of Ahmed where he was apparently giving an interview.Given the image of Ahmed Abu Jazar wearing military uniform with a weapon, he has been accounted for as a militant in Airwars’ upper belligerent range, though not in the lower range as this could not yet be confirmed by other sources. He has also not been included in the lower casualty range. See our methodology for more details on classification of militants and civilians. The range will be updated should further information come to light.Rabie Juma Abu Jaza was remembered in a Facebook testimony by Ismael Abu Jazar where he was described as a “decent young man”.Where possible, Airwars has matched names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26th.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed13 – 14(4–6 children3 women5 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli MilitarySuspected targetPalestinian ForcesBelligerents reported killed0–1, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed13 – 14(4–6 children3 women5 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli MilitarySuspected targetPalestinian Forces, Belligerents reported killed0–1, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed13 – 14(4–6 children3 women5 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli MilitarySuspected targetPalestinian Forces, Belligerents reported killed0–1"

The family relative Yamen Nofal wrote in a Facebook tribute that around 30 family members of Dr. Amin Mohamed Abdullah Nofal were killed after the dawn prayer.The news outlet Russia Today reported that numerous injuries resulted from the strike, citing a correspondent in Gaza Mustafa Al-Bayed who described “dozens dead and injured at the site”. Photos of the aftermath of the strike show widespread destruction, the home totally collapsed and surrounded by piles of rubble.The State of Palestine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on the bombing in a Facebook post, calling it a “massacre against the Nofal family in Gaza”. It also shared the pictures of the destroyed family house and of the list of victims in Arabic.Facebook account Nusayrat camp reported about 27 killed members of the Nofal family, having attached a picture of some of the victims. A tribute by Intisar Nofal on Facebook shared the images of the destroyed Nofal family house, pictures of the young children killed in the attack, including a smiling girl in a pink dress, and the list of the victims in Arabic language.A Facebook testimony by the relative of Dr. Amin Nofal, Yamen Nofal, helped to identify at least 27 names of the family members, but it is evident that the death toll was higher as the identities of some children were not provided. Taking into account the children who were mentioned among the victims without their names, the death toll may reach up to 34 civilians. Alongside the images of some family members, Yamen Nofal also shared the graphic images of the dead bodies of the small children having been killed in the attack as well as an image showing a row of bodies in white bags lined up with at least four appearing to contain small children.A 62-year old head of the family Dr. Amin Mohamed Abdullah Nofal was killed alongside his 60-year old wife Dr. Tammam Yousef Khalil Nofal, their sons Moatasem Amin Nofal, Maysara Amin Nofal, and Moamen Amin Nofal, daughters-in-law and grandchildren. Yamen Nofal called the late Dr. Amin Nofal “the dean” of the family and showed a photo of a mid-aged man sitting at a desk with a button-up shirt and black tie.The eldest son 35-year old Moatasem Amin Nofal lost his life alongside the lives of his wife, a 34-year old Maryam Muhammad Nofal and their four children: a 14-year old son Ahmed Moatasem Nofal, an 11-year old son Ali Moatasem Nofal, a 1-year old daughter Fatima Moatasem Nofal and a 6-year old daughter Amna Moatasem Nofal. Yamen Nofal shared an image of Moatasem Nofal where he appears as a young man in a palestinian scarf.A 32-year old Moamen Amin Nofal was killed alongside his wife Enas Nofal and their four children, including his 6-year old son Islam Moamen Nofa and his 4-year old son Mahmoud Moamen Nofal.A youngest son of Dr. Ameen Nofal, a 29-year old Maysara Amin Muhammad Nofal was killed alongside his wife Shaima Nofal and their children.Ameen and Tammam’s other son Mustafa Amin Nofal survived the attack, but lost his 33-year old wife Nabila Nasr Nofal and their four children: a 4-year old daughter Tamam Mustafa Amin Nofal, a 14-year old son Muhammad Mustafa Amin Nofal, a 12-year old son Amr Mustafa Amin Nofal and a 11-year old son Ali Mustafa Amin Nofal.Ameen and Tammam’s other son Muhammad Amin Nofal lost his three sons in the deadly attack: a 16-year old Amin Muhammad Nofal, an 11-year old Hamza Muhammad Nofal, and an infant Ahmed Muhammad Nofal. One post by Yamen commemorating Amin Muhammad Nofal shows a young man posing for a photo with what appears to be a gun, raising the question of whether he was connected to militant activity. However, this is the only photo showing him with a gun, and does not necessarily mean he was a member of an armed group.Among the victims killed in the strike mentioned in the post by Yamen Nofal were also his cousin, a 41-year old Mahmoud Nasr Nofal and his four sons, of which only the name of an 11-year old Ayoub Mahmoud Nofal was provided. Nofal also mentioned a 1-year old Mayas Moaz Nofal, a daughter of Moaz Amin Nofal, as having been killed.In another Facebook post Yamen Nofal mourns the death of one more Nofal family member, a young man Nasser who is seen in the attached image in a black leather jacket.The deadly attack also killed a seven-day-old child Nabilah Nofal, dubbed “the youngest martyr in Gaza” by Donya news. She was reportedly born the day the war began on October 7th. The Palestine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs shared a video showing the shrouded body of Nabilah alongside her mother also killed in the strike. The MFA commented on the video: “The Nofal family massacre: The mother is always safety in life, and in Gaza she is also safety, even in death! The video is of an infant, one of the youngest martyrs in the Gaza Strip, being placed next to her martyr mother as they rose with the rest of the family as the Israeli war machine bombed their home over their heads.”According to social media reports, the strike also took the life of a pregnant woman. A Facebook user Abu Hazin wrote a heartbreaking tribute from the perspective of the infant Nabila and a fetus of the pregnant woman, attaching the graphic images of the fetus and of the body of Nabila wrapped in a green cloth: “They promised me there [would be] air after the fluids of the womb, but I found nothing but dust…I knew that we were born in the place where no one cares.”Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The incident occured around dawn., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed27 – 30(16–19 children5 women6 men)Civilians reported injured12–24Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed27 – 30(16–19 children5 women6 men)Civilians reported injured12–24Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed27 – 30(16–19 children5 women6 men)Civilians reported injured12–24Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Multiple local and international sources including Alkufiya, Refugee PS, Palestine Post, and RT news later stated that 25 civilians were killed in the bombing, with RT News also reporting the “the injury of dozens”. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign affairs confirmed the casualties in a tweet that said “25 were martyred in the targeting of the Ziyadah family home in the town of Beit Lahia, north of the Gaza Strip”, accompanied by an image of a destroyed building with children searching among the rubble.Airwars identified the names of the two killed victims of the strike. Abu Hamza mourned the death of his elderly father Haj Khamis Ziyadah (Abu Wael), sharing an image of his lifeless face on social media, and the death of his uncle Sami Ziyadah (Abu Muhammed) in the bombing. The late Sami appears as a smiling middle-aged man on the image attached to the Facebook post.Neighbours, friends and relatives also posted their tributes to the killed victims, with Saed Shihada calling Abu Wael Ziyadah a “good neighbor”, and Moaz Aziz saying “The martyrdom of Uncle Sami Ziada Abu Muhammad joins Uncle Khamis Ziada Abu Wael in the same place and at the same time. May God have mercy on them and make their abode in Paradise, O Lord.” Another relative of the family mentioned the death of Sami’s wife without giving a name.A family relative Ines Tili Zaono wrote that a large part of the family had been killed in Gaza in the 2014 conflict after being displaced, with much of the Ziyadah family “displaced to Gaza, and the remaining few to the West Bank and refugee camps in the Arab world.”Both civilians identified were found among the Ministry of Health list of names released on October 26th.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed17 – 25(2 men)Civilians reported injured12–24Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed17 – 25(2 men)Civilians reported injured12–24Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed17 – 25(2 men)Civilians reported injured12–24Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Initially Ramallah News reported the death of four children and a serious injury of a fifth child, but most sources later spoke about the death of five children.The airstrike that killed Ali al-Qadi was confirmed by the Israeli military. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) wrote on its website: ”Based on precise IDF and ISA intelligence, IDF aircraft neutralized Ali Qadi, a company commander in Hamas’ “Nukhba” commando force, who led the brutal terror attack against Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip last weekend (October 7th).“ The IDF posted a video which showed the moment the Israeli Military bombed the home of Ali al-Qadi.Hespress also quoted an anonymous Hamas official who stated that the late Ali al-Qadi was indeed a militant, describing him as a field commander in the elite force of the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Movement. However, there was no official comment on the death of Al al-Qadi from Hamas, as reported by Hespress.Originally from Ramallah, Ali al-Qadi was imprisoned in 2005 and released in 2011 as part of an exchange deal for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. According to Israeli news website YnetNews, “Ali al-Qadhi was sentenced to life in prison for 2005 for kidnapping and murder of his employer.” After his release, Ali al-Qadi was deported to the Gaza Strip where he lived with his family until his killing on Friday October 13th, 2023. According to Ynet news, “he continued to engage in terrorism; Last Saturday [07/10/23], he commanded some of the terrorists who participated in Hamas’s murderous attack on Israeli border towns.”The wider al-Qadi family and the people of Beit Nuba, the al-Qadi’s homeland, published a tribute on Facebook mourning the death of Ali al-Qadi, his wife Sajida Abu Hayya and their five children. The post read: “Today, the people of Beit Nuba, as they mourn the sons and wife of its mujahid and their liberated prisoner son, Ali, the judge deported to the Gaza Strip, also mourn all the sons of the Palestinian people who rose during the repulsion of the aggression (…) and will remain stubborn against his defeated forces.”Al-Bireh Association also expressed its sympathy on Facebook for the wider al-Qadi family, adding that: “(…) Due to the circumstances the country is going through, the funeral will be held for one day today, Friday, at the Lifta Al-Bireh Association, near Al-Hayat newspaper, after Friday prayers”, and posted a picture of four of the sons of Ali.A brother of the late Ali al-Qadi, Ayat Alqadi, posted his testimony, mourning the death of his brother’s wife and children and sharing the image of the five smiling sons of Ali, one of them still being an infant.Where possible, Airwars has matched names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26th.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces, and the Israeli military confirmed the strike that killed Ali al-Qadi and his family.The exact time and location of the strike are unknown, but based on a Shehab agency tweet, the attack happened in the evening shortly before 11:36 PM.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusDeclared strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed6(5 children1 woman)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Known belligerentIsraeli MilitaryKnown targetPalestinian ForcesBelligerents reported killed1, Strike statusDeclared strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed6(5 children1 woman)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Known belligerentIsraeli MilitaryKnown targetPalestinian Forces, Belligerents reported killed1, Strike statusDeclared strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed6(5 children1 woman)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Known belligerentIsraeli MilitaryKnown targetPalestinian Forces, Belligerents reported killed1"

Shehab Agency reported that there were numerous other injuries and potential other deaths in the incident, but this was not corroborated by other sources nor have other victims been named.Al-Zard was born on Dec 24th, 1972, and reportedly had eight children. His son, Baraa, had been killed the previous month allegedly by Israeli forces during border protests.Al-Zard obtained a masters in Hadith from Islamic University in 2001. His dissertation is reported to have been titled: “Manifestations of Pre-Islamic Time as Depicted by the Sunnah Texts.” He would later be granted a doctorate from the joint program between Gaza’s al-Aqsa University and Egypt’s Ain Shams University.Al-Zard taught at The University College of Applied Sciences, and had previously worked for the al-Quds Open University and the Islamic University of Gaza. He was the imam of the Grand al-Omari Mosque in Gaza City, as well as the al-Mahatta Mosque in the al-Daraj neighborhood.Al Jazeera reported that he was the director of the Fadhila Women’s Forum Center, which worked with women in education as well as providing social and cultural support. The Center also provides a Qur’anic teaching center for girls. Outside of this, al-Zard also worked as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Tayseer Marriage Association.He was also engaged in Islamic activities outside of his professional life: he had represented Palestine in 1997’s “Holy Quran Memorization Competition” held in Mecca, after reportedly memorising the holy book in 1992.Al-Zard was affiliated with Hamas, though the strength of this affiliation is not entirely clear. Though Reuters named him as a “well-known” Hamas cleric, The New York Times claimed he was a “less senior” figure within Hamas, and reported he was “a preacher affiliated with the group.” The Extremist Monitoring Analysis Network stated that he was also aligned (whether by ideology or tangible affiliation) with the Muslim Brotherhood.He was known to have made highly antisemitic statements, often in his sermons.

The strikes hit a convoy of citizens fleeing northern Gaza after instructions from the Israeli military to evacuate. Some reports said the number of civilians killed might be more than 70, with at least 150 and up to more than 200 civilians reported injured, including many displaced women, children and elderly people. Airwars was able to identify at least 12 victims killed by name.According to an investigation carried out by the Financial Times and Airwars, the deadly explosions took place between the State Roundabout and the Kuwait Roundabout near the Bassem Aliwa Steel Company building. The incident occurred the day after Israel told more than one million civilians living in northern Gaza to flee south for their own safety.A forensic review of the visual material by the FT/Airwars found that the explosions did not hit the truck carrying a large group of Palestinian civilians directly but a group of cars nearby, with the shrapnel likely responsible for the deaths of the majority of the fleeing civilians – who were seated on an uncovered truck.Israel denied striking the street and suggested Hamas may have planted explosive devices along the evacuation route. Military analysts consulted by the Financial Times and Airwars said the shrapnel appeared consistent with an Israeli strike.Palestine Alarabiya and Saddam Souad shared gruesome videos on Facebook showing the direct aftermath of the attack – burned cars and dead bodies lying on the ground amidst blood. Financial Times and Airwars Investigations wrote that videos of the aftermath verified by the media showed 12 bodies of men, women and children in Salah-ad-Din street, which Israel later designated a “safe route”. The media outlet also wrote that there were probably two explosions, one of which damaged an ambulance as it attempted to leave the scene with some of the injured.The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza confirmed that “large numbers” of dead and wounded, including women and children, had arrived at Al-Shifa Hospital.Initially Almamlakah TV reported about 40 civilians killed and more than 150 civilians injured, but later the government media office spoke about a higher death toll of 70 victims killed and more than 200 injured in its press statement. Shehab Agency reported about the “death of more than 70 Palestinians and the injury of hundreds.”Many victims of this attack remained unidentified. Palestinian Media Center shared the images of its crews performing funeral prayers for the unidentified deceased Palestinian civilians over the bodies wrapped in white cloth stained with blood.Based on Facebook testimonies by family members, Airwars has identified 12 victims killed in the strike.The deadly attack took the life of the wife of journalist Sameh Murad and injured a number of his family members. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate extended its condolences to the colleague, who worked with Al Arabiya channel and remained at work to cover the events of the subsequent Israeli invasion of Al-Shifa Hospital.The Amara family lost six family members, according to a Facebook post by Mahmoud Amara. A family relative Ahmad Amara shared that he lost his sisters, 24-year old Hanan Ayman Abdel Karim ‘Amara and 25-year old Safaa Hasan Muhammad ‘Amara, Hanan’s children and her fiance, and her fiance’s brother – 26-year old Adham Ayman Muhammad ‘Amara.

Two young men were featured in the pictures attached to his Facebook post.Youssef Atef Dabbour Asad mourned the death of his father, his brother Mohammad Dabbour Asad and his nephew Atef Dabbour Asad.Among the victims of the attack was also “the polite young man”, Ismail Muhammad Al-Taweel, remembered in a tribute by Taweel and Shaar Ffamily on Facebook.There were also victims killed from the Lanoush family. A heartfelt Facebook testimony by Lanoush Lanoush said”: “My uncle, my cousin, his wife, and my cousin were martyred, and their two sons were seriously injured, and they are in intensive care on their way to Salah al-Din.” However, Airwars did not find names and additional information about these victims.Where possible, names of the victims have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, most sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces. In particular, BBC news and the Financial Times reported that based on video footage, the explosions were most likely caused by strikes launched by the Israeli military.Financial Times carried out its own investigation in conjunction with Airwars, quoting a munition expert Desmond Travers who had investigated attacks across the globe including in Gaza. According to him, the attack was most probably carried out with a “precision-guided shrapnel-delivered missile”. He added: “There could have been several of them to create the effect I am seeing on the videos. If that is the case, then the attack would have been carried out by the Israelis.” However, Travers did not exclude the possibility of an improvised explosive device (IED) on the site being used. A spokesperson for the Israeli military, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus, however, denied the allegations and stated that “Hamas is behind this, is using the death of Palestinian civilians for its vile political purposes”.According to the investigation carried out by Al-Arabi Open Source Investigations Unit, the attack happened around three o’clock in the afternoon. The BBC investigation ascertained that the incident happened between 15:30 and 17:20 local time.The incident occured between 3:30 pm and 5:20 pm local time., SummaryStrike statusContested strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureHumanitarian evacuationCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed12 – 71(3 children3 women6 men)Civilians reported injured150–201Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingContestedCompeting claims of responsibility e.g. multiple belligerents, or casualties also attributed to ground forces.Suspected belligerentsIsraeli Military, Palestinian Militants, Strike statusContested strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureHumanitarian evacuation, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed12 – 71(3 children3 women6 men)Civilians reported injured150–201Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingContestedCompeting claims of responsibility e.g. multiple belligerents, or casualties also attributed to ground forces.Suspected belligerentsIsraeli Military, Palestinian Militants, Strike statusContested strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureHumanitarian evacuation, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed12 – 71(3 children3 women6 men)Civilians reported injured150–201Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingContestedCompeting claims of responsibility e.g. multiple belligerents, or casualties also attributed to ground forces.Suspected belligerentsIsraeli Military, Palestinian Militants"

A dreamy, ambitious, intelligent, kind girl who loves us and we love her. She loves all things.” Besan’s teacher Dr Belal Aldabbour wrote on X: “I mourn my student Bisan, a future doctor whose life was cut too short.”In a Facebook post from Besan posted earlier this year, months before her death, she mourned the loss of her friend’s brother and wrote of her pain in living in the region: “Life in Gaza is unbearable. Everything here is unfit for life and every event here is painful. Our days are only nightmares, there is no life on this earth.” Later, in a post she wrote soon before her death, Besan said, “I have dreams I have not yet fulfilled,” and a “life that I have not fully lived.” Just two days before she was killed, Besan also mourned the loss of her teacher Dr. Al-Fadil Mohamed Al-Dafour.In another post Sherine remembered Marah Halasa, a recent graduate who loved to draw and paint:, “Have fun, we will miss you a lot, I swear. We are going to come and congratulate you on your graduation.

Most sources agree that the home of the deceased was “directly” bombed by the Israeli military.Safa news agency reported that Muhammad Fahmi Al-Najjar, who is a member of the Board of Directors of the National Authority for Documentation and Prosecution of Occupation Crimes, was killed alongside his parents, his family and that of his brother’s family in the alleged airstrike. The grandparents of the family, 74 year old Fahmi Muhammed Al Najjar and 74 year old Fatima Khalil Al Najjar, were killed alongside their two sons and wives, 41 year old Muhammad Fahmi Al-Najjar and his wife 34 year old Haneen Al Najjar, and 36 year old Firas Fahmi Al-Najjar and his wife 30 year old Samah Al Najjar, and their grandchildren: Muhammad’s six children Fahmi Mohammed Al Najjar, 14 year old Omar Mohammed Al Najjar, 13 year old Abdulrahman Mohammed Al Najjar, 4 year old Yousef Mohammed Al Najjar, 3 year old Anas Mohammed Al Najjar, and 5 year old Fatima Mohammed Al Najjar; Firas’ four children 5 year old Yaman Firas Al Najjar, 7 year old Obaida Firas Al Najjar, 10 year old Fatima Firas Al Najjar, 3 year old Sara Firas Al Najjar.Following the incident, colleagues and family members have paid tributes online. Muhammad Abu Sharab, the nephew of counselor Muhammad Fahmi Al-Najjar, acknowledged the death of his uncle in a Facebook post that also alleged that the airstrike had killed all family members inside the home of Muhammad Fahmi Al-Najjar.Dr. Ramy Abdu, a colleague of the deceased, posted on Facebook following the alleged airstrike. He paid tribute to his colleague Judge Habib Fahmi Al-Najjar (likely referring to the grandfather Fahmi Al-Najjar), Judge Fatima Khalil Al-Najjar (Al-Makhalati), and the heads of the lawyers’ bloc, their sons Muhammad Fahmi Al-Najjar and Firas Fahmi Al-Najjar, who were also killed during the incident. The Palestinian Bar Association Gaza also identified the grandfather of the family as “Counselor Judge Fahmi Al-Najjar”. At the time of his post, Dr Abdu reported that civil defense crews were still trying to recover the victims of the alleged airstrike.These tributes often provide an insight into the personality of those killed. Dr Ola El-Najjar, the son of Judge Fahmi Muhammad al-Najjar, described his father as a man that embodied “compassion and generosity” and his mother – Fatima Khalil Al-Najjar – as a woman that “combined gentleness, tenderness, and love” for her children and grandchildren.The post of Dr Ola El-Najjar provides insight into the family of the deceased. His brother, Muhammad Fahmy Al-Najjar and his sister-in-law Haneen Al-Najjar were killed alongside their six children during the incident. Muhammad was described as “the caring brother who is dutiful to his parents and sisters, and companion to his wife, known for his intense love for his children, his mercy toward those near and far, and his generosity with everyone, and my advisor in all my steps” and his wife Haneen as “a kind and generous person who had memorized the Qur’an”. Dr. Ola also described Fatima as named after her grandmother “so that she would remain Fatima in his eyes and heart”, and Yousef “with his beauty, who loved my daughter Shoshu and called her (Aunty Shoshu)”.It is also revealed that his other brother, Firas Fahmy Al-Najjar and his wife Samah Al-Najjar, who were both engineers, were killed alongside their four children during the bombing. Dr Ola described his other brother Firas as “the beloved, close friend, righteous companion, and intelligent, sharp mind” and his wife Samah as “the wise engineer… and a girl of principles”. Their children were described as Fatima who “is similar to her mother in character”, Obaida “the beloved son of the beloved, with his white face that blushes at the slightest praise”, Yaman who would always hug his son Muhammad because of their love for football.Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed16(10 children3 women3 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed16(10 children3 women3 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed16(10 children3 women3 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

The Ministry of the Interior in Gaza reported the bombing of the Dawas family home on October 14, and stated that the family were buried under rubble and civil defense and ambulance crews were working to rescue them.Arabi21 reported that there were dozens killed and injured in the incident. A Facebook post by a family member Ramzi Dawas listed the names of seven identified killed victims (four from a previous incident) noting that “there are still martyrs from the family, as many as 15 martyrs whose names are not mentioned under the dots” and called for help in retrieving the bodies from the rubble. Due to this post, the exact address of the incident is likely house Lahia, entrance of Ezba Dawas, west of Abbas Kilani roundabout, Al Shaima Street.Across all sources, 14 victims were named/identified and reported as killed.The victims were named by their family members as Maher Dawas (56) and his sons Youssef Maher Dawas (20), Fadi Maher Dawas (30), Abdel Rahman Maher Dawas (16) and Obada Maher Dawas.

He had published an essay with the collective, We Are Not Numbers, in January 2023 called “Who will pay for the 20 years we lost?”, recounting the destruction of his family’s orchard in May 2022 by an alleged Israeli missile strike and how the loss of the orchard, to quote from the essay, “destroyed an important piece of our past. Our family’s history. Our heritage.” Youssef was also a contributing writer in Palestine Deep Dive and the Palestine Chronicle where his last article had been titled “Kidney Transplant and Rebirth: A Palestinian Love Story”.

Images provided by @ShehabAgency show children and an elderly man among the injured. One source, @Arab-Storm, reported that the victims were from both the Al-Louh family and the al-Huwaili family.One source reported on Facebook, on October 14th, that 17 members of the Al-Louh family were killed in the incident. However, it is unclear if they are referring to just this incident or since the campaign on October 7th.The victims who were killed were named by various sources as 72-year-old Hajja Aisha Muhammad Al-Louh, who was the wife of Hajj Abu Hamdi Al-Louh, and 31-year-old Fidaa Hussein Al-Louh, who was the wife of the former prisoner Imad Mustafa Al-Louh. Three of Fidaa and Imad’s daughters were also killed, six-year-old Majd Imad Mustafa Al Louh, four-year-old Waad Imad Mustafa Al-Louh and one daughter* whose name was not reported by the Ministry of Health in Gaza. 23-year-old Najlaa Al-Sayed Al-Louh, who was the wife of Fouad Mustafa Al-Louh, was killed alongside their daughters, two-year-old Quds Fouad Mustafa Al-Louh and four-year-old Mecca Fouad Mustafa Al Louh. 25-year-old Alaa Mustafa Al-Louh, who was the wife of Muhammad Odeh Abu Sneina, was killed alongside her daughter* whose name was not listed.One relative, Alameed al-Mukhtar, claimed that four daughters of Fidaa and Imad were killed, whereas all other sources reported that three daughters were killed. Similarly, Alameed reported that three daughters of Najlaa and Fouad were killed, whereas all other sources reported that two of their daughters were killed. This discrepancy has been accounted for in the civilian casualty range.One source, named Mahmoud Ramadan, on October 27, 2023, made a post on Facebook listing the names of 22 victims from the Al-Louh family whose deaths were recorded by the Palestinian Ministry of Health since the conflict began on October 7, 2023. This source did not claim that the victims were all killed in this incident (ISPT0191). Therefore, the civilian casualty range recorded by Airwars for this incident is based on sources that listed civilian casualties specifically related to the bombing of the Al-Louh family home on October 14, 2023.The house that was bombed belonged to Hajj Mustafa Al-Louh also known as Abu Nhad.*Airwars has quantified them as children based on the ages of their family members and the images of the victims.Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified a belligerent, all sources attributed the incident to the Israeli Military.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed10 – 12(6–8 children4 women)Civilians reported injured20–21Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed10 – 12(6–8 children4 women)Civilians reported injured20–21Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed10 – 12(6–8 children4 women)Civilians reported injured20–21Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

The strike reportedly killed Palestinian surgeon Dr. Medhat Mahmoud Saidam and his extended family at his home. Among the dead were between 24 to 31 civilians, including at least 12 children*, seven women (including a pregnant woman), and seven men. Whilst all sources agreed that Dr Medhat Saidam was killed, alongside his family, different sources identified different family members allegedly killed in the attack.Twitter user @dryouceff and the Palestinian Ministry of Health said Dr. Medhat Mahmoud Saidam had been working for seven consecutive days at the Indonesian Hospital before the strike occurred. Interviewed by Al Jazeera, doctor Ahmed Makhlalati confirmed that statement, saying that his colleague Dr Medhat Mahmoud Saidam was coming home to see his family and planned to go back to the hospital but was killed when a strike hit his house at around 1 am. @Gredto reported that Dr. Saidam was killed along with 30 members of his family.On Facebook, Dr. Ahmad Mokhalalati described Dr Medhat Saidam as “one of the pioneers of plastic surgery and burns in Gaza”, “a big brother”, “a compassionate human being” who “devoted his life to serving patients, providing care for them, and educating the new younger generation”. He also added: “I cannot imagine what the atmosphere of the place would be like after him. I cannot imagine our morning meetings without him joining us with his enthusiasm and positive energy…May God have mercy on him and his entire family.” A tweet from Gredto added that “the doctor specializing in plastic surgery contributed to alleviating the suffering of those wounded in the Gaza wars 2009-2014”.A Facebook post from Dr. Medhat Saidam’s cousin, Mohammed Saidam, named the following victims killed: Dr Medhat Mahmoud Saidam and Dr Medhat Saidam’s mother, Umm Medhat, married to the deceased Dr Mahmoud Saidam.

As Aed Abu Mohsen’s name was found among the Ministry of Health list of fatalities, it seems that he died of his injuries.One source, Abood Abu Howidy, reported that the house contained 30 members of the Al-Masry and Al-Akhras families.A funeral procession was planned to move the bodies, at 10:30 am on October 16th from Al-Najjar Hospital in Rafah to al-Namsawi Stadium next to the local cemetery.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.

Yousef was seven years old when he was killed, after the roof of their house collapsed, according to the BBC report. Jury and Hamid both survived the attack with injuries.Yousef’s father is described by the BBC as a radiographer at the Nasser hospital in the city of Khan Younis, who was working a 24-hour shift when “his wife, Rawan, entered, screaming in search for their youngest son”. Videos were widely circulated of Rawan calling for her “handsome and curly-haired son”. According to a Facebook post, Doctor Hamid and his wife searched emergency and recovery rooms for three hours, before finding Yousef in the morgue.“The last time I saw Yusof alive was when he ran to hug me on the doorstep of our home, just before I left for work,” Mohamed told the BBC. “He kissed me and said goodbye after I had given him some biscuits and bananas. He wanted to be a doctor, maybe because he always saw me going to hospital for work.”Further Facebook posts identify Hani Fathi Abu Masa as a family member of the Abu Musa, also killed in the incident. However, Abu Musa’s Facebook posts make his relation to the family unclear.An image posted by mohannadalkhteeb on Instagram also identified “a number of injuries” with images of two injured children and an injured man. Yousef’s mother, Rawan, had been able to find nine-year old Hamid after the strike, while rescue teams had helped pull 13-year old Jury out of the rubble.

The same source added that the doctor used to organise “hundreds of science discussions” at his place, and covered their expenses with his own money. Adnan Skaik wrote in his Facebook post that the doctor “was kind-hearted, easy-going, loving towards his students and loved meeting with them”. He also said “In the last meeting I had with him, he asked to prepare a meeting with all the college students to discuss a book he had prepared, but the date of his martyrdom was closer.” Farwana Family account on Facebook indicated that Dr. Omar Saleh Farwana was “one of the deportees of Marj al-Zuhur”.The doctor’s son Abdulaziz Farwana with his wife Sondos Manar Farwana and his daughters 3 year-old Maryam Abdel Aziz Farwana and 17 day-old infant Ayat Abdel Aziz Farwana were also killed. Nazmila Alqawasmi wrote in a Facebook post that “Ayat was certainly sleeping in the arms of her mother”.Among the victims was also the doctor’s daughter Dr. Aya Farwana.

I remember how her house was bombed for the first time during a war, and I spoke to her to console her, and she began to console me and comfort my heart.

According to Al-Jazeera, Nofal was fourth on the Israeli Military’s list of targets for assassination. His death was confirmed by a post on the Al-Qassam Brigades’ Telegram account.In April 2024, the Israeli magazine 972 reported that to kill Nofal the army had “authorised the killing of approximately 300 civilians, destroying several buildings in airstrikes on Al-Bureij refugee camp on Oct. 17, based on an imprecise pinpointing of Nofal.”Only one other militant was confirmed killed – another fighter in Hamas’s military wing named Hamed Al-Qarnawi.In a post on Facebook, Avichay Adraee, the head of the Arab media division of the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, declared that “IDF warplanes, under joint guidance with the Shin Bet, liquidated one of the most prominent Hamas leaders, Ayman Nofal” and claimed that Nofal “directed numerous terrorist attacks against Israel and the security forces, and directed missile launches, with special guidance to target areas populated by Israeli civilians.” The IDF also published reconnaissance footage of the strike, which was reposted by some of the sources documenting the resulting civilian harm.Al-Jazeera reported that Ayman Nofal had been arrested and detained by Israeli Forces three times in 1991 and once by the Palestinian Authority in 1997. Another source, Bãjãli Nãîf, reported in a post on Facebook that Nofal participated in the 2006 kidnapping of an IDF soldier, Gilad Shalit, as well as being involved in the development and production of weapons.Multiple sources reported that, after an incident in 2008 at the Rafah crossing, Nofal was arrested by the Egyptian authorities for possession of a weapon and reportedly was detained for three and a half years without official charge before taking advantage of the political chaos of the Arab Spring uprisings and escaping from Al-Marj prison in Egypt in January 2011 to return to the Gaza Strip.Where possible, Airwars has matched names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26th, with some additional names reconciled with lists released later.The incident occured around midday., SummaryStrike statusDeclared strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed92(40–47 children28–30 women17–19 men)Civilians reported injured13Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactHealthcareImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

Al-Ahram news quoted UNRWA as saying, “At least six people were killed this afternoon as a result of the bombing of an UNRWA school in the Maghazi refugee camp in the central region of Gaza.” The source also referenced the statement made by the organization’s Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, who corroborated that dozens, including UNRWA employees, were injured and that “the school had suffered severe structural damage.” The statement suggested that the casualty numbers were likely to be higher. Urgent From The Rest reported about 10 civilians killed and dozens wounded.WAFA News Agency and Facebook user “Going Back to Palestine” shared the images showing the aftermath of the deadly strike: the walls of the school with large holes in them, lots of broken furniture and rubble. A graphic video posted by Electronic Al-Nadaa Portal on Facebook showed bodies being carried out of the school.The sources differed about the nature of the strike. The Palestinian Ministry of Interior and National Security and some local sources said that the school was hit with artillery while UNRWA reported an airstrike.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The incident occured in the afternoon., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureSchool, UN facilityCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed10 – 24Civilians reported injured12–24Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducationImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

The lowest death toll provided by local sources was 15 killed.Photos of the shrapnel from the weapon that hit the house have circled social media, as have photos of injured people, the rubble, and victims in body bags. Family and friends have written heartfelt messages on Facebook. Mosa, the brother of Elham, wrote “With hearts that believe in God’s will and power, today my beloved sister, the martyr, bled (Elham Hamdan Abu Muammar). Her husband, the martyr (Muhammad Ihsan al-Lamdani), and their martyred sons”. Mohammad wrote “May God have mercy on your soul, O Abu Hassam, a clean, respectable and decent man. I testify to your honesty and politeness. A thousand mercy and light descend on your grave, my dear. May God reward you, Khan Yunis. We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return.”18 year-old Dima al-Lamdani lost most of her family, including her parents, seven siblings and four members of her uncle’s family. Dima, who was trapped under rubble after the explosion (and is pictured with cuts on her face), described the horror of waiting to be found: “The time I spent waiting to be found were some of the most horrifying moments. I was about to lose my mind.” She was luckily found alive in the rubble after waiting for help for several hours. In an interview with the Reuters she said “This is a nightmare. It will never be wiped from my memory,” she said. “I had a sister, 16. They wrote my name on the white sheet they wrapped her body in, they thought it was me.” To the Guardian, she spoke of her disillusionment of a future without her family: “I am crumbled now. No dreams, no hopes, no plans. I can’t imagine my life without my mother, sister and father. The Israeli forces betrayed us. There is no place that is safe.” Dima, her brother, and her two younger cousins were pulled from the rubble and were the only survivors from the family. This coincides with another source, Bashira Akkad, which also mentioned that “only 4 of them survived serious injuries”.Where possible, Airwars has matched names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26thThe type of strike is contested on social media, with some sources saying it was an explosive barrel or another internationally banned weapon.

Hamas officials did not comment on his status.The condolence messages in the social media helped to identify four family members killed in the deadly attack on the house reportedly belonging to Ismail Haniyeh’s brother. The bombardment killed Ismail Haniyeh’s son Dr. Hazem Ismail Haniyeh, his 50-year old brother Abdul Khaleq Khaled Haniyeh (Abu Malik), his nephew Abdel Khaled Haniyeh and his brother’s grandson Ahmed Haniyeh. It was reported that “a number of his grandsons” were killed, but the name of only one of them is known.Abdul Khaleq Khaled Haniyeh was remembered in a Facebook post by “My Hope in God is Big” where he was called “ the cousin who is dear to all of our hearts”.

Among those who lost their lives were Sawsan Ahmed Muammar (wife of Mahmoud), aged 54 (924300650); their son, Muhammad Mahmoud Saeed Barbakh, aged 13 (429488653); their grandson, Uday Makram Aouni Barbakh, aged 17 (424184737); Kholoud Mahmoud Saeed Barbakh, 21 (daughter of Mahmoud and Sawsan) (408537231); Sabreen Mahmoud Saeed Barbakh, 32 (daughter of Mahmoud and Sawsan) (803466366); and Samar Imad Al-Masry, 26, (daughter-in-law of Mahmoud and Sawsan) (403095318); Sally Ramez Muhammad Abu Muammar, 4 (daughter of Sabreen); and Saba Ramez Ahmed Barbakh (daughter of Sabreen).Jihad Barbakh, a family member of the deceased, provided the names of the 10 members of the Barbakh family who were killed, in addition to mentioning that “more than 10 martyrs were passers-by on the road”, indicating that there were at least 10 additional deaths.Local reports emphasised the absence of any forewarning prior to the attack. Immediately following the incident, eyewitness videos emerged which depict a scene of panic followed by a swift and substantial mobilisation of rescue operations. Local sources, including the Palestinian Health Ministry, reported that a number of casualties who were pulled from the rubble managed to reach Nasser Hospital, others could not be saved.In the days and weeks preceding the incident, surviving members of the Barbakh family have paid tribute to their lost loved ones on Facebook. Most poignant of all was a November 3, video post from Mostafa Mahmud, husband of Samar Imad Al-Masry, showing their daughter one-year-old Sawsan Mustafa Mahmoud joyfully playing in her home. Mostafa explained that the video was captured less than five minutes before the airstrike hit their residence.Multiple sources, Alaraby News and Safa News, reported that “injuries” resulted from the bombing but did not provide a toll.

Given the lack of specificity in reporting, Airwars has graded the harm status as “weak” until further information comes to light.Due to none of the accounts directly naming Israel as the belligerent, the strike status has been graded as “contested”.

Anas and Muhammad have not been counted as civilians due to an allegation they may have been militants (see below), though this was unconfirmed. This will be updated in event of additional information.A post from Facebook user Sameh Hakim referred to the death of his aunt, Imtathal Ahmed Abu Makhda, along with the death of Dr. Salem and his family.There were expressions of grief from the victims’ personal and academic communities, especially for Dr. Salem Abu Makhda, a professor in the Faculty of Sharia and Law at the Islamic University of Gaza and the Deputy Dean of the faculty who taught and supervised Master’s degree students. Salem Makhda was also described as the “deputy” to the Dean of the college, Dr. Tayseer Ibrahim. Ibrahim was the head of the judiciary in Gaza, which was under the control of the Hamas militant organisation. He was killed on October 12th, 2023 (ISPT0169) in an alleged Israeli strike.A student of Salem Akhda, Abo Esmet Hasaneen, shared a Facebook post in which he lamented the loss of his “forensic supervisor in [his] master’s degree.” An accompanying picture shows the two in academic regalia. Dr. Salem Abu Makhda was described as a “pillar of the Faculty of Sharia and Law at the Islamic University” by another one of his students Mohammed El Madhoun in a Facebook post. El Madhoun wrote: “(…) he was the best doctor, friend, and close to the heart, and he did not spare our day with his knowledge and good character. May God accept him.”Amr Abu Qsim further expressed his pain of losing his brother, posting pictures of Dr Salem Abu Makhd and his two sons, smiling proudly, in what appears to be a classroom.Maher Hawali also expressed his grief for their sister Najat Hamid Al-Houli (Umm Osama)’s death, describing her as “my dear, caring, loyal, truthful, chaste, and pure sister, the educator of the memorizers and memorizers of the Qur’an” along with her husband, who was described as a “distinguished scholar, jurist, writer, and virtuous preacher and educator.” Their children Anas Salem Abu Makhda, Muhammad Salem Abu Makhda and Islam Salem Abu Makhda were described as those “who memorises the Book of God.” While both Anas and Muhammad were described as “mujahid” in the obituary – a phrase commonly used for Palestinian militants – it is unclear whether this expression referred to their potential combatant status.

The video shows the collapsed building and the street covered in debris and thick dust, while men attempt to remove people from the rubble.

Sources on local and social media corroborated this information, including Shehab Agency, al Arabiya Palestine, Gaza News Now, Gaza Live, the Palestinian Information Center and al Jazeera, with images of the injured Yousef shared holding his American passport. Sources also posted videos of the bombings, with Gaza Live sharing footage of a house bombed “near al-Quds hospital”, and al Jazeera revealing footage of an explosion near the hospital. It is unclear whether this was the home of the Abu Shaaban family.The family was treated at al-Shifa hospital where they remained for close to two weeks, before moving to al-Ahli hospital, where Jamila had shrapnel removed from her leg and the rest of the family underwent surgery. A surgeon who treated Jihan there is quoted by the Guardian as describing her arm “like a shark took a bite out of it and took the bone and nerves and tendons.” Yousof recorded a heart-rending video of himself and posted it to social media, asking, “Where is this country that should protect me?” His interview with Al Jazeera has him confirming the death of his sister and the injuries of his family, saying, “What did we do to deserve this? We are civilians, everyone here is civilians.” Yousef’s father Abedalazeez “studied at Western Michigan University and worked in the state for several years” according to Ultra Sawt. Yousef’s cousin Bahjat Abushaban in Michigan said he received news from other family members that doctors weren’t sure if they could perform surgery necessary to save Yousof’s injured arm.The Guardian reported that the surviving family has since traveled to Rafah once again to await evacuation, during which they “had to carry a white piece of flag saying we are defeated” according to Abedalazeez. Yousof’s US citizenship allowed for Jamila and Jihan to travel to the USA in December after the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund offered to treat Jihan’s hand injuries at the Shriners hospital in Philadelphia.

Also, the 12-year-old son of the journalist Hazem bin Saeed, Anas Hazem Hassan bin Saeed, and his 13-year-old daughter Aseel Hazem Hassan bin Saeed were killed in the alleged attack. According to PBS News, the strike levelled the family’s three-story home.The Palestinian Press Agency, Safa, reported that Israeli military aircraft had bombed the home of journalist Hazem bin Saeed, east of Deir al-Balah, leading to the death of his parents, brother, and sister-in-law. About an hour later, at 6:39am, the news agency further reported the death of the the journalist’s young son, Anas.The following day, Safa, reported that “the child Aseel, daughter of journalist Hazem bin Saeed, died as a result of her injuries after the bombing of her family’s home yesterday, east of Deir al-Balah, bringing the death toll from this massacre to 6 martyrs.”On October 21st, an account named Without Money Balas announced on Facebook the death of a seventh member of the bin Saeed family, writing “after three days, under the rubble of his house, the child Hassan Hani bin Saeed was taken out. Did he call in a low voice and no one listened? Did he inhale gunpowder dust? Did he call for his mother but she did not hear because she had died? Did he call for help from his father but he did not respond because he died? They were killed by Israel. They did not mourn each other, as they were all dead.” The account also shared a graphic photo of Hassan’s body after it had been retrieved from the rubble.Numerous loved ones shared their grief online following the deadly airstrike. On Facebook, Thana’a Alaidy wrote “Praise be to God who granted my cousin Abeer Khairy al-Aidi and her husband to bear martyrdom on the land of Gaza today,” while Abdallah Akram Mohammed posted “today, the comrade, brother, friend, and good man rose as a martyr. Hani bin Saeed Abu Ahmed, his father, his mother, and his wife” along with a smiling photo of Hani, a middle-aged bearded man in a white shirt. Mahmoud Youssef shared a photo of Hani as well, with the caption “friend and colleague, the martyr engineer Hani bin Saeed Abu Ahmed, may God have mercy on you, my dear.”Many offered their condolences to journalist Hazem bin Saeed, a surviving member of the bin Saeed family who lost many of his loved ones in the strike – a mother, father, brother, and two children. A video shared by fellow journalist, Ahmad Abu Alraws, shows Hazem in tears as he kisses and prays over the shrouded bodies of his relatives. Elbalad News and Facebook accounts, Kari Abdallah Thabet and Alnusairat Extended Family Gathering mourned Hazem’s loss as well.Hazem himself has also shared his grief online since the strike. On October 20th, he wrote “My dear, compassionate father and my dear, kind and unparalleled mother, and my engineer brother… Hani and his wife Abeer and her son Hassan, and my eldest son Anas. Today, my dear daughter, the poet, called Aseel, died. There is no power nor strength except with God.”On October 31st, Hazem honoured his brother Hani, writing “Yesterday was my brother Hani’s birthday, 10/30, and two weeks ago I bid him farewell with the family, O Lord, be patient with this separation.” In this post, he shared a photo of two men sitting in a garden and smiling at the camera. On January 20th 2024, Hazem shared a photo collage, writing “I ask God Almighty, Lord of the Great Throne, to forgive my mother, father, brother, and children, and to admit them to Paradise without judgment, O God, Amen.”A PBS News story on parents whose children have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza sheds further light on Hazem’s loss: “Aseel Hassan was an excellent student, said her father, Hazem Bin Saeed. She devoured classical Arabic poetry, memorizing its rigid metric and rhyme scheme, and revelling in its mystical images and florid metaphors. During the war, when Israeli bombardments came so close that their walls shook, she would regale her relatives by reciting famous verses from Abu Al Tayyib al-Mutanabbi, a 10th-century Iraqi poet, her father said. “When I asked her what she wanted to do when she grew up, she would say, read,” said 42-year-old Bin Saeed. “Poems were Aseel’s escape.”The names of all victims killed, except for Aseel Hazem Ahmed bin Saeed have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, the strike was attributed to Israeli forces.The incident occured at approximately 5:30 am local time., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed7(3 children2 women2 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed7(3 children2 women2 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed7(3 children2 women2 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Several sources claimed he had been deliberately “targeted” for his work.English-language Carthage Magazine pointed to the strike as an example of the dangers journalists face, writing “half of all the journalists that were killed worldwide in 2022 have been killed by Israel in Gaza in just 11 days,” with Twitter/X user @Hamzaalnamla1 reported that the brothers had been found “in body parts.”All sources that identified a belligerent attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed2(2 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed2(2 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed2(2 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Nineteen members of the al-Kurd family were killed in the incident.The patriarch of the family, 58-year old Zuhair Abdel Qader al-Kurd was killed with his wife, 51-year old Rabeia Mahmoud Abdel Razzaq al-Kurd. Their son, 29-year old Abdel Fattah Zuhair al-Kurd and his wife, Aya Salman, were also killed, as were their two young children: 2-year old Zuhair Abdulfattah Zuhair al-Kurd and 4-year old Layn Abdulfattah Zuhair al-Kurd.Zuhair and Rabiaa’s second son, 20-year old Muhammad Zuhair al-Kurd was killed with his brother, 16-year old Ahmed Zuhair al-Kurd, and sister, 18-year old Nada Zuhair al-Kurd.Other family members were also killed: the 6-year old child Habiba Abdul Qader Zuhair al-Kurd, and mother and son Faten Anwar al-Kurd and Ahmed al-Kurd.20-year old Amr Adnan al-Kurd was killed with his sister, 14-year old Sama Adnan al-Kurd. A pregnant Aseel Ayman Ahmed al-Kurd was killed, as was Amani Ibrahim Ahmed al-Kurd. Lastly, Maryam Ahmed Harb al-Kurd was killed with her two daughters, 15-year old Rawan Hassan al-Kurd and 17-year old Sarah Hassan al-Kurd.There were no reports of injuries following the incident.Little detail was shared about the victims, with most friends and family instead sharing prayers and hopes for afterlife redemption. Facebook user Sahar Mahmoud described Maryam al-Kurd as her “creative and literary predecessor.” Sahar lauded Maryam’s daughters, Sarah and Rawan, for having both memorized the Quran. Maryam appears to have also done so.Family, friends, and journalists shared images and videos of the funeral online with words of consolation for the family. The family’s pain was very evident: images of the funeral show crying women, one of whom has collapsed. A graphic photo shared by Facebook user Abdullatif Tawfic shows the aftermath of the strike: a man cradling a teenage boy who is bloodied and wrapped in a body bag. Twitter/X user @M86950933 attached a photo of the funeral where three children–one of whom appears to be an infant– can be seen also wrapped in body bags.In his farewell to those killed, Twitter/X user Ahmad al-Kurd said, “The heart is sad, and I am saddened by their separation. May God accept them, forgive them, and make them dwell in the highest paradise in Paradise.”Facebook user Ahmed Noor Eldin Basheer remembered his “neighbors and brothers” and asked that they be accepted “to the gardens of bliss.”A Facebook post from the Al-Kurd Family was the only source to attribute the strike to the Israeli military.

Muhaisen has been categorised as a militant but the other 18 victims were all reported to be civilians.A statement from the Israeli military declared the strike, describing Muhaisan as “Head of National Security of Hamas” and labelling him a “key terrorist operative.”The airstrike reduced the home to rubble, and civilian volunteers were reported to have recovered a number of people from the wreckage. Photos posted by one of the family’s relatives, Jamil Muhaisen, and another Facebook user, Khaled Alhamarnh, indicate that the strike killed young children.The death of the 53-year-old Jihad Abd Suleiman Muhaisen was confirmed by the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Hamas movement – as reported by Alghad News. In the images of the late Jihad Muhaisen shared by Atef Abdulghani, Ahmad Arafat and Menara FM, he is seen as a middle-aged bearded man in a military uniform and a green beret.Family relative Jamil Muheisen posted a list of the civilian members of the Muhaisen family killed in the incident.

My aunt, her husband, her children, their wives and grandchildren, my aunt’s daughter and her daughters, her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren, and my cousins.”The Haboul family shared that Areej was a daughter-in-law of the late Fatima Daoud Haboul. Mansoor Arhaim Arsh offered his condolences to the surviving husband and father, Nidal Banna, adding that the victims were bombed in Rafah where Israeli forces “said the south was safe”, and mourning “Oh God, comfort his heart with this great affliction / Oh God, our hearts are filled with sadness and loss, and we can no longer bear it / Have mercy on us, O God.”Rafah Service shared that the entire family of Ali Hassouna “was removed from the civil registry”, calling the bombing “a direct targeting of civilians” and sharing an image of Ali, a smiling middle-aged bearded man. The Rafah Municipality referred to Ali as “our colleague”, stating on October 20th that the “crews of the Central Emergency Committee in Rafah Governorate continue to work on removing the rubble and recovering the bodies of the martyrs”, and shared images of the rescue efforts.In a news report, Gulf365 media stated that the bombing occurred when Areej was carrying out household chores. The family was expecting the birth of a boy child soon, and had named him Omar, with Gulf365 quoting a relative, Ali Hassouna, who said: “We were happy and Areej was happy that she was going to have a son, and she said we would name him Omar after my brother who died a while ago, but suddenly the bombing started and destroyed the house and she and her foetus came out from under the rubble, but she was dead.”Initially the family clung on to the hope that the foetus would survive, but these hopes were not realized, with Ali Hassouna saying “We were thinking she died, but the foetus is alive, and we had hope, but it faded when the doctors removed the foetus and it was dead. At that time, our hearts stopped crying, all of us. What we are experiencing in Palestine is a human tragedy that no people before us have experienced.”Moaz al-Hams reported that there was “severe damage to the surrounding homes”, with al-Aqsa voice further detailing that the house “was completely destroyed. It was made up of 4 floors”, and that the severely damaged neighboring homes included the “Kabaja family home, the Kurd family home, the Matar family home, the Musa family home, and the al-Banna family home (from Gaza).”Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The incident occured at approximately 10:26 pm local time., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureReligious Institution, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed35(14 children14 women6 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureReligious Institution, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed35(14 children14 women6 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureReligious Institution, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed35(14 children14 women6 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Hamza’s father’s cousin, A. Mohammad Abu Daqqa Abu Mahmoud, posted on Facebook that the family house was completely destroyed, having posted an image of the rubble left from the building.Hamza Bashar Abu Daqqa was mentioned in tributes by his family members as “the Memorizer of the Book of God” which means that he learned the Koran by heart. His aunt Rasha Alnajjar wrote a touching testimony to his nephew: “My dear, Hamza Bashar, I was talking about you as a leader, and you turned out to be a leader in every way. Brave, intelligent, and this is what I sensed since your childhood. It is enough that you have won the world and memorized the Book of God. And in the hereafter, you will rise as a martyr.”Another relative, Houria Dehiba wrote in a heartfelt Facebook post: “They killed you and your dreams and the dreams of your mother.”Hamza Bashar appears in the images shared on Facebook by his relatives as a smiling young boy in diverse locations, including one picture in a traditional attire.Airwars has matched Hamza Bashar Jamil (Abu Daqqa)’s name to the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The incident occured around dawn., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 child)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 child)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 child)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

The blast destroyed parts of the church complex where hundreds of displaced civilians were reportedly taking shelter.Airwars identified the names of at least 23 civilians killed, including ten children, eight women and five men across three families. Sources reported at least 18 more civilians were injured, though by some accounts there were ‘dozens’ of wounded civilians, and potentially hundreds more under the rubble.The three families identified with multiple civilian casualties were the Al-Amash family, Al-Souri family and Al-Tarazi family. The Higher Presidential Committee of Churches Affairs in Palestine (HCC) described scenes with “entire families whose names were erased from civil records, children whose body parts were found under the rubble, and a girl no more than 4 months old who was found martyred in the arms of her grandmother who was also martyred.”Sources described St. Porphyrius Church as the oldest church in Gaza, and potentially of the oldest churches in the world. According to HCC, “the original building dates back to the year 425 AD, and it was renovated in 1856.”On Twitter/X, @AvichayAdraee, the IDF Spokesperson, declared that Israeli forces intended to strike a target adjacent to the church, allegedly used as a Hamas command center. The said statement read: “The IDF can unequivocally state that the church was not the target of this raid”. Another Israeli forces statement quoted by Al Jazeera further highlighted that as a result of the strike, “a wall of a church in the area was damaged,” and that the IDF were “aware of reports on casualties” and that “the incident is under review.” As the IDF did not officially acknowledge any civilian harm as a result of the bombing, the civilian harm status of this incident has been graded as “fair” by Airwars, and not “confirmed”.The Holy Orthodox Foundation of Saint George, quoted by @ytirawi on Twitter/X, claimed that Israeli forces targeted “the hall of the church with four missiles”, while The Guardian reported that “a missile brought down part of the complex”. Ibrahim Al-Souri, a survivor, interviewed by Al-Jazeera, told the media that “two raids” hit the building.Victims identifiedLocal sources, religious authorities such as The Church of Holy Land, and relatives of victims on social media provided obituaries and published lists of names of victims either killed or injured, alongside pictures of them. Members of at least three family units, Al-Amsh family, Al-Souri family and Al-Tarazi family were identified by local sources. Justin Amash, on Twitter/X a relative of the Al-Amash family, said the bombing “killed multiple members of three connected Orthodox Christian families, who are my relatives. They are my dad’s first cousins and their spouses, children, and in-laws. May their memories be eternal.”Based on these sources, Airwars identified the names of at least 23 victims killed, including eight women, ten children and five men, and one woman, one child and one man injured, as the following:The Al-Amash familyYara Grace Al-Amash (Al-Amsh) was reportedly killed alongside her daughter Juliet Sobhi Al-Souri (Al-Suri, Al-Suwari) and her son, a baby identified as George Sobhi Al-Souri. A relative of Yara, @justinamash, posted a picture of an infant, identified as George, covered in dust, with his eyes closed, being pulled out from the rubble, carried by a man. @justinamash said “This is my second cousin George being pulled from the rubble at Saint Porphyrius Orthodox Church in Gaza. This beautiful baby committed no crimes, harmed no person. May his memory be eternal.” At the funerals held the next day, one woman showed a picture of an infant to the cameraman in a video published by @TRTArabic, saying “this is George, everyone, this is George” while another voice can be heard saying “Where is the little boy?”.Yara was described as the wife of Sobhi Al-Souri, who, according to HCC, was wounded in the same attack and transferred to the hospital to be treated for a foot injury. The same source said that “as a result of the lack of medical resources and the lack of appropriate treatment, the doctors expect that there will be a need to amputate one of his feet.”Local sources reported the deaths of Marwan Salim Tarazi, his wife Nahid Tarazi, and their granddaughter, the infant Joelle Attala Al-Amsh. Joelle Attala Al-Amash is likely the daughter of Attala Al-Amash. 4 month-old Samaa Al-Amash was also reportedly killed. She was described as the daughter of Attala Al-Amash and his wife Miral. According to HCC, Miral also lost both her mother and father in the bombing – their names were not provided by the source. Miral’s family name, which could not be found, could presumably be Tarazi, and her parents are likely to be Marwan Salim Tarazi and his wife Nahid Tarazi, as these civilians have been described as Joelle’s grandparents.Sources further identified Grace Issa Al-Amash as one of those killed.The Al-Souri family (also referred to as Al Suwari)Tariq Sami Al-Souri was reportedly killed with his wife Lisa Walid Al-Souri, and their son Issa Tariq Al-Souri.Ghada Al-Souri was also counted as one of the killed victims, alongside her children – 15 year-old Suhail Ramez Al-Souri, 7 year-old Majd Ramez Al-Souri, and 9 year-old Julie Ramez Al-Souri. According to local sources, Ghada was married to 45 year-old Ramez Al-Souri. PBS interviewed Ramez who explained that strikes scared his child Majd, and that his son “missed playing soccer with his school friends. [Majd] was devastated that the war had canceled his Christian family’s … trip to Nazareth, “Baba, where can we go?” Majd asked again and again when airstrikes roared”. Souri told PBS that Majd calmed down when they arrived at the church to take shelter. PBS reported: “They prayed and sang. (…) Majd was found beneath the rubble with his hands around his mother’s neck. His face was completely burned. “My children just wanted peace and stability,” said Souri, his voice cracking. “All I cared about was that they were happy.””HCC similarly explained that Ramez lost his three children, and described his farewell message: “My daughter was [as beautiful as] the moon, it was crazy. They killed her.” An elderly woman, whose name was not provided, presumably Ramez’s mother, can be seen crying in despair in a video published by @ajmubasher, saying “The loves of my heart, the children of my son, all of them are dead! Ask God to have mercy on them! How could I want to go home? How can I come back without them? Where could I want to go? I can’t see our home again, I don’t want to go home! They bury me with them, bury me with them!” Farida.tarazi posted an obituary which read “With hearts filled with pain, we mourn the children of my dear nephew Ramez with the martyrdom of all three of his children in the bombing that targeted the church” alongside a picture of three children side by side, smiling.Ramez also lost “his cousins and their wives from the Al-Amash family” according to HCC, though their names were not provided by the source. As Airwars identified members of Al-Amash family killed but cannot be sure these victims were included, two men and two women were counted as a minimum in Airwars’s maximum casualty estimate to account for them.Abdel Nour Sami Al-Souri was killed with his wife Viola Grace Al-Amsh, and their infant daughter Alia Abdelnour Al-Souri. Yousef.alashqer said on Facebook that the whole family was killed, and that “Abdel Nour was named in the latest coordination list, and he was not able to travel like any other people, and we agreed to go out together if the opportunity allowed.” This presumably is a reference to the official list for those permitted to leave the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing into Egypt.HCC added that Abdelnour had “recently completed his master’s studies and his martyr wife wrote, “I wish you continued success and hope for a doctorate.” Viola has been described as a relative of Yara (also killed, see mention above) in an obituary posted by @justinamashm.The Tarazi familyDr Suleiman Jamil Tarazi, a 35 year-old dentist was also killed, while his wife Lili and their son, a three year-old Jad, were both reportedly injured. According to HCC, “the last person to be found was the dentist, Suleiman Tarazi, and his wife was unable to say goodbye to him due to a very serious injury to her spine, and his children were not able to say goodbye to him due their state of panic.”Rana Mourtaja, a friend of Al-Tarazi family, said Lili was in “intensive care suffering from various fractures in her body”, while Jad was being treated as he sustained “multiple fractures” . She described Lili as her childhood friend. Rana wrote: “[Lili’s] small family consists of four people, her husband, Suleiman, and Jamil, her eldest son, born in April 2017, and Jad, born in July 2019. (…) Language has not helped me since day one. I cannot formulate a single sentence to console any of my friends. May God have mercy on Suleiman, give patience to the entire family, heal Lili and her son, and hasten their relief. How do all these horrors cram into one geographical spot called Gaza? How do I formulate a phrase in which I console my old friend with the tragedy of her life? How will Jamil and Jad understand that daddy was shrouded, mercifully wrapped and buried deep in the ground?”. @OsaidesserMD said that Suleiman’s wife and children were critically injured but the medical condition of Jamil, their second son, was unclear.Dr Suleiman Tarazi was also mourned by Nadia Abu Nahla, who published a message on Facebook: “Goodbye, Suleiman. Goodbye, our hearts are aching. May God have mercy on you, martyrs of the Church of Saint Porphyrius”.According to Rana Abo Farha, other members of Suleiman’s family were also killed including Elaine Helmi Tarazi. Muntaser Tarzi announced Elaine’s death on Facebook, saying she worked as the “director of several public schools”. She was described as an “excellent educator” by Nadine.shaheen, and as working as a nanny for Al Tarazi family by HCC.On November 27th, William.tarazi posted an obituary, announcing that the elderly woman Eva Salim Musa Tarazi succumbed to wounds sustained in the bombing of the church.Two other victims killed were identified as the child, Christine Al-Turk (killed), and Nasseem Saba.Washington Post quoting The Order of St. George indicated that the “Archbishop Alexios appears to have been located and is alive, but we don’t know if he is injured.” No other information could be found on him.Unnamed victimsAs in many incidents of civilian harm, not all victims were named by sources.@Kahlissee on social media said that “a married couple and their newborn daughter were among 18 Palestinians killed when Israel bombed Gaza’s oldest church.” This source could refer to the deaths of Abdel Nour, Viola Al-Amash and Alia (see above – Al-Amash family).@hms____1 posted on Twitter/X a video of a woman with a head injury. Her name was not provided. @RTarabic and @skynewsarabia published a video of an elderly woman described as having “special needs” who was rescued from the rubble of the church – she was not identified by the source. @AlahdathArabian published two pictures of injured children being held by rescuers, without providing further details on the kids. One survivor quoted by Al-Jazeera, told the media ““One lady is waiting for her three kids to be pulled out of the rubble, It’s something you can’t really imagine, you can’t really explain.” Neither the names of the children nor their condition were indicated by the source.Civilians under the rubbleVarious local and international sources recorded a number of civilians trapped under the rubble, with The Guardian of the Greek Orthodox Church, quoted by @SupportProphetM estimating their number at “more than 200”. Local reporting also described ongoing rescue efforts following the attack. One member of the rescue team stated during a video released by @ajmubasher that there was no sufficient equipment that could support in pulling out the bodies.HCC narrated the scene: “the search for bodies and survivors” was conducted “in the dark of the night due to the deliberate power outage by the Israeli occupation in all of the Gaza Strip. The residents, the clergy, the fathers, the priests, and the monastery and Church officials had no choice but to search the remains of the victims in the lights of mobile phones. Their voices rose, calling for those who thought they were still alive under the rubble. This person called out, “Oh Suleiman,” and a grandmother called out, “Tata, if you hear me, answer me.” And a grieving mother crying and screaming in the name of her daughter, who was not more than 4 months old. .” The Guardian further explained that “Dozens of men searched the collapsed building into the night, looking for survivors – and for bodies to retrieve the next day.”Overall death toll estimatesSources provided various estimates regarding the number of civilians who were taking shelter inside the Church complex at the moment of the attack. These estimates ranged between a 100 to 500, with The Supreme Presidential Committee for Follow-up of Church Affairs in Palestine providing the highest estimate. One survivor, Ibrahim Al-Souri, quoted by Al Jazeera, said that these were mostly “children, women, elderly and sick people”. As the Church is a complex of multiple buildings, most sources reporting on those sheltering did not specify how many of them were in the building that was hit by the bombing.While early reports of exact casualty numbers were challenged by the scale and nature of the incident, there was consensus among sources that this was a mass casualty event, with reports by the following afternoon from Church officials putting the death toll at least at 18 civilians and “several” children, as reported on by Al Jazeera. After identifying additional names through social media, Airwars has however raised this minimum death toll to 23 civilians.Pictures of injured civilians were released on social media by multiple sources, while @SARASMAYRA1 on Twitter/X published images of victims at the hospital. @mrowesna123 suggested that nuns could be among those wounded but no other sources provided further details to corroborate this.Two other sources gave higher estimates of the death toll: the Holy Orthodox Foundation of Saint George, quoted by @ytirawi, affirmed that Israeli forces bombing led to 150 estimated “martyrs” while only one source, @ElmadhonHosam said that the number of victims exceeded 400 injured and killed.On October 20th, The Guardian said that among the victims killed were “four tiny children”, while @Lolwah_Alkhater put the number of children killed at seven, and @zoo_bear at eight. Relying on local and social media sources, Airwars recorded the names of at least ten children killed from the three different family units outlined above. Palestinian resident, Ibrahim Jahsan, interviewed by Al-Jazeera, told the media that the kids who survived the attack were all “traumatised”, adding that “No words can describe what we are going through.”According to several sources, including @AJArabic and @TRTArabiv, and the Guardian, mass funerals of victims were held the next day in the courtyard of St. Porphyrius Church. Many Muslims and Christians attended the ceremony, @TRTArabic reported. A video recorded by the source showed heartbroken relatives of children killed holding phones to show pictures of them to the camera. @AJA_Palestine also published a video covering the ceremony.Airwars will update our casualty range should further information come to light.Destruction of the Church complexMultiple local and international sources reported that the strike led to the complete destruction of the headquarters of the council of the church. The building was also referred to as the “Church Stewards Council” by the Palestinian News and Press Agency, quoted by Anadolu Agency. The building was described as a two-storey building part of the church’s compound. HCC further explained that the Council was “one of the abandoned houses adjacent to the church”. A rescuer told Reuters that the civilians sheltering in the lower floor of the building were crushed to death, buried under the rubble, while two civilians sheltered on the upper floors survived.Al Jazeera described scenes of shock and disbelief from the survivors following the attack: “a number of members of the Greek Orthodox [religion] who survived the bombing appeared sitting next to the church in a dazed state, waiting for the remaining bodies of the victims to be removed from under the rubble.”Father Issa Musleh, interviewed by Al Jazeera, said “People there – Muslims and Christians – they thought they’d be safe inside the [church] building – Because it’s a church, they didn’t think it would be bombed by Israel.” The church had been previously used as a sanctuary, with both Muslims and Christians taking shelter in its buildings during former Israeli military campaigns, the same media noted.HCC added that the blast also led to the complete destruction of the church “entrances”. A statement by the Order of St. George, quoted in The Washington Post, claimed that two halls, which were areas where refugees, including “children and babies” were sleeping, were destroyed by the blast. Justin Amash on Twitter/X, a relative of several victims of the attack, said that while the sanctuary had not been destroyed from the strike, “the church annex, which includes offices and meeting spaces for the Christian community” collapsed following the attack.Additionally, according to HCC, the attack destroyed “all the warehouses in which the church stored water, food, grains and canned food”.The New York Times explained that the church is composed of “a chapel, seven buildings and a courtyard”. Only two sources, a man interviewed by @ajmubasher and a resident, Maher Ayyad, interviewed by Washington Post, reported that around a hundred civilians were in the bombed building. Maher Ayyad further explained to the Washington Post that “around 400 displaced civilians, mainly Christians, were taking shelter in the entire complex.” Similar estimates were provided by HCC which stated that 382 Palestinian Christians were taking refuge, spread inside the various buildings constituting of the church: “Christian families were distributed among all the different church facilities, including facilities that included Sunday schools, halls adjacent to the church, or the headquarters of the Council of Deputies, which was a place that was destroyed along with those in it.”@ShehabAgency reported that among the victims were displaced Palestinian Christian civilians who had taken refuge in the church. According to a man interviewed by @ajmubasher, the Palestinian Christians in Gaza who were displaced and took shelter in that church constituted half of the Christian population in Gaza. @AlarabyTV correspondent stated that those forcibly displaced came from Zaytoun neighborhood in Gaza, an area that that Israeli forces asked to be evacuated.According to HCC, “the church was notified more than three times to evacuate the survivors towards the south” – though the source did not indicate when the warnings were sent to the church. However, @AJArabic recorded an eyewitness who claimed that no prior warning was given before the strike.One survivor told Al Jazeera said that he had decided to stay in the church with his relatives, despite the risks: “We were baptised here, and we will die here.” The Washington Post interviewed a Palestinian American living in the US, with relatives and friends who were sheltering inside the church, who told the media: “They’re terrified. They’re shaken. They don’t know what to do, and they don’t know where else to go.”The Patriachate reportedly condemned the attack but stated that the church was committed to continue offering “shelter to the displaced” in Gaza city, despite evacuation orders. The Washington Post alleged that “Around 500 other Christians” relocated to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate School in Gaza City.HCC recorded the attack at around 8:30pm.Where possible, Airwars has matched names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names, ID numbers and ages released on October 26th.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

Al Arabiya reported in a post on Twitter/X that a church was also bombed.Eight civilian victims were identified by name. Three victims were reportedly killed alongside their families and children – in line with Airwars’ methodology, the minimum number of civilians killed has therefore been recorded as 14. A family member, Hazem Eliwa, reported that 22 victims had been killed. A witness in a video posted by Al-Arabiya reported that 28 bodies had been recovered from the site and more remained buried under the rubble. A tweet from @palestineultra also identified other “wounded” individuals as a result from the strike but did not provide an exact toll.Samir Kanaan shared a post, mourning the loss of his family and friends: 52-year-old Nidal Masoud Hameed Eliwa (also known as Abu Hamed) and his family, Abu Amer and his family, the wife of Mustafa and their children, as well as the wife of Mohammed Saleem and the son of Ahmed Saleem.The Zaytoun Group identified 52-year-old Taysir Musa Ibrahim Ishteiwi (also known as Abu Hamza) and his wife as further casualties in the incident.In a message of grief on Facebook, Mostafa al-Shahmi reported that his cousin Walid Omar Shaaba had passed away and posted a picture of Walid from when he was alive.Ola Khabbas mourned the death of another victim, Muhammed Shaana (Abu Hamed) in a tribute to him, which stated, “You were our hope… the pearl of our dreams…” In another post, Ola said, “You left us, but your spirit lives in our hearts and all our souls.” Images posted by Ola in a slideshow showed Muhammed Shaana carrying a weapon and wearing uniform. The slideshow included images of a flag of the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in a cemetery. Airwars has therefore classified Muhammed Shaana as a militant.In a video posted by Al-Arabiya on Twitter, civilians interviewed at the scene said that a mosque and church with women and children inside had been hit and that 28 bodies had already been recovered. Video footage showed civilians digging through rubble in a large crater, searching for victims. The minaret of a mosque and a church spire can be seen in the background.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Where possible, names have been reconciled with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities published on October 26, 2023.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

Other sources quoted the Ministry of Interior without providing additional details. Airwars has graded the civilian harm status as weak due to the repetition of details and circular nature of the reporting, but will update should further information come to light.According to Al Jazeera, Israeli “aircraft launched a series of raids on citizens’ homes in the Shujaiya neighbourhood, east of Gaza City”.Alghad news agency stated that Israel launched “a series of violent raids on the Al-Shujaiya neighbourhood, east of Gaza City.”Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

The source said: “We brought out a number of martyrs, most of whom were women and children, while many remained under the rubble. We needed more than 4 hours to get them out, given that we work with our hands and do not have tools.”The family members killed were members of the Al-Kahlot family: grandfather Suhail Al-Kahlot (65) and his wife Ghada Abel Rahman Al-Kahlot (55) were killed alongside their daughters, Reham Suhail Al-Kahlot and Haya Suhail Al-Kahlot (31), and their sons, Hassan Suhail Al-Kahlot (34), Mahmood Suhail Al-Kahlot (26), Hadi Suhail Al-Kahlot (25), Abdul Rahman Suhail Al-Kahlot (19), and Ahmed Suhail Al-Kahlot (28).

Based on a post from Muhammad Abd al-Rahman al-Kahlot (sister of Ghada) it seems likely that this refers to their children and their children’s spouses. @ahmedalkahlout also mourned “the children of the deceased Maher Abdul Rahman Younis Al-Kahlot, his wife [Magda Youssef Abu Watfa], and his 9 children” – based on the same post from Muhammad Abd al-Rahman al-Kahlot (sister of Ghada) it seems likely that this refers to their children, their children’s spouses, and their grandchildren.Mohammed H. Alkahlout posted that his aunt Ghada’s family had been displaced and was sheltering with the family of Magda Abu Waft.Reham Al-Kahlot was said to be a volunteer at Al-Matar project that provides educational and cultural opportunities to the blind. A Facebook post from the Al-Matar project expressed profound grief over the loss of Reham. The post emphasized that the project considers her not just a volunteer but a family member. The project also extended heartfelt condolences to the community mourning her tragic death. Ahmad Arafat also posted a condolence message for his “colleague” Reham, a medical analysis specialist. My Voice – SAWTI, a United Nations Development Program, also mourned the loss of Reham and identified her as a graduate of their Voice Program.The Management of the Indonesian Hospital also posted a condolence message to Dr. Atef Al-Kahlot, Director of the Indonesian Hospital, on the death of his brother and his family. The hospital also published a statement from Dr. Atef which read “We receive martyrs and bid farewell to martyrs, and we are still standing at the top of our work.

The post included a picture of Abdul, who appeared under five.Shehab Agency initially reported that three civilians, “two women and a girl,” were killed during the strike. However, later reports indicate that the death toll may have been much higher. Multiple sources claimed that many of those killed and wounded during the incident were trapped under the rubble of the Al-Astal family home during the early stages of reporting; it is likely for this reason that initial casualty counts were low.Facebook user Khaled Abdel Salam Abu Walid posted a video showing the aftermath of the strike. In this video, people are seen congregating around a building that has rubble scattered around it. An accompanying image shows a wider shot of the affected area, where there are clear indications of damage. At the time of the post, Khaled Abdel Salam Abu Walid stated that 8 civilians had been killed and “many” wounded.The Safa PS News agency reported that the total number of civilians killed during the airstrike had risen to 20 by dawn the next day. This was confirmed by Facebook user KhaledAbdulsalam, in a post in which he named 20 members of his family who had died during the incident.Images showed the destruction caused by the strike. Pictures attached show multiple bodies wrapped in body bags being transported—presumably to a hospital or burial ground— in the bed of a truck.Facebook user Adel Zourub, who identifies as an official journalist, posted additional images of the bodies being loaded onto the truck by plain clothed individuals. One of the individuals can be seen holding a swaddled bundle in his arms, presumably of a young child.Another Facebook user, Alkhalijiu, also attached images documenting the harm wrought on children, including a photo of a young boy on a stretcher.

The incident also caused “massive destruction” to the area according to a report by Wattan news agency.New agencies such as Al Jazeera, Shehab Agency, Al Wattan and Safa News reported the alleged Israeli air strike on the house. All of these sources reported that the incident was caused by Israeli Military aircraft. Al Arabiya Palestine also posted a video of the bombing on Facebook and Al Jazeera posted a video of its aftermath on Facebook, with civilians moving around the rubble and fires still burning. According to a post from Alkataweta Family Boys Gathering, the home belonged to the late Hajj Abdul Karim Abu Sharia “Abu Tafesh”.A post on a Qatatawa family Facebook page originally reported that seven people had been killed and that rescue crews were still searching in the rubble for other family members. Another source, Ramzi Alhasayna, later reported in a post on Facebook that 13 people had been killed and that crews continued to search for more victims. Multiple sources described victims having been buried under rubble. Altogether, Airwars identified 15 names of victims that were reported as killed in this incident.The official Qatatawa Youth League Facebook page posted the names of the family members killed, including pictures of some of the family members killed. 56 year old Ahmed Abdul Karim Abu Sharia (also known as Abu Aram or Abu Nidal) was killed alongside his brother, 48 year old Jamil Abdul Karim Abu Sharia (also known as Abu Khaldoun), and Jamil’s adult sons, 26 year old Khaldoun Jamil Abu Sharia and Malik Jamil Abu Sharia and his young daughter 13 year old Raneen Jamil Abu Sharia.

Sources did not clarify how they were related to other family members. Another two female family members called Maryam Ibrahim Abdel Aziz Abu Sharia and Noura Abdel Aziz Abu Sharia were killed. One source, Fayek Abu Aker, posted an image on Facebook of Ahmed and Jamil, with text overlaid, reporting that they had died alongside their wives and various family members. Therefore, it is possible that their wives are amongst the victims listed above, however this cannot be confirmed.Four grandchildren of the family were reportedly killed; a set of young brothers, two year old Omar Bashir Abdul Karim Abu Sharia and Ahmed Bashir Abdul Karim Abu Sharia as well as two sisters, Dana Muhammad Ibrahim Attia Abu Sharia and two year old Basma Muhammad Ibrahim Attia Abu Sharia.Family members and friends, in multiple Facebook and Twitter/X posts, lamented the deaths of the family members, made heartfelt tributes and posted pictures of them from before the incident. The Abu Sharia family comes from the Qatatawa tribe and some of the tribute appeared on Facebook groups of clan members. The related Abu Akar or Al-Akour tribe also expressed their condolences in a post on their Facebook page. Mohammed Al-Rawaak Abu Shehab described Jamil Abu Sharia as a brother, friend and companion and posted a photo in which Jamil had his arm around him and they were smiling. A video posted on Facebook by Abu Mehdi Abu Sehlol showed Jamil smiling while he sat eating at an event with dancing lights around him. A post on an Abu Sharia family Facebook page showed pictures of Ahmed, Jamil, Khaldoun, Malik and Ibrahim while they were alive as well as another picture of two small smiling children, possibly Omar and Ahmed. A picture of Ibrahim posted on Facebook by Jarad Mohammed showed him standing in a field and laughing.Multiple sources reported that “injuries” had resulted from the strike but did not provide a toll.A family member called Ramzi Alhasayna reported in a post about the incident on Facebook that the Al-Hasayna Abu Sharia family had refused to leave their home and that crews continued to search for family members under the rubble.

Based on images, Airwars has quantified at least seven injuries of children.Sources spoke to the mental impact the strike had on the children, with Twitter/X user @SafaaALssaedy referencing a video that showed a young boy, mentioned as belonging to the Sobh family, “trembl[ing] with fear.” Nabd News also included this video, showing two boys, both distraught, receiving medical care after reportedly being taken to hospital following the strike.Multiple sources posted videos and pictures of a young girl in a matching butterfly vest and trousers. In a video shared by Twitter/X user Khaled Iskef, she is being carried away from the site of the alleged airstrike on a stretcher with another young child, and has significant injuries to her face and head. The same video shows multiple children being carried away from the destruction. In a later video shared by @KimJongWins, this girl is lying on a bed, presumably at a health facility, and crying.The second young child seen being carried on the stretcher is photographed being held by an adult in a post by Shehab Agency; it appeared they were seeking medical attention.Shehab Agency posted a photo of what looks like medical assistance vehicles parked up at the site of the alleged strike.

There are seven children in the picture which includes the young toddler who was carried off on the stretcher.Bisan Owda, a Gaza-based reporter who has come to international prominence, posted a video with a young girl who she named as Sham Sobh, and identified her as a survivor of the strike. Sham appeared with shrapnel cuts to her face, and seemed confused and numbed after her experience. Bisan stated that 35 members of Sham’s family had been killed, but given that none of the sources describing this incident mentioned these additional deaths, these family members were likely in other incidents.Beyond Sham, there were no names included within reporting.Multiple sources mention that the strike occurred on the market area of Beit Lahia.The imagery included within the sources suggest that the strike took place during the daytime.

A small drum. A toy piano.”Khalil added that in 2014, the neighbours’ house was bombed while his wife was pregnant “in her seventh month and almost fell down the stairs from the blast. And I was thinking, how can I bring children into this life? (..) I had a dream for each of my kids. Ibrahim was first in his school and I dreamed about seeing him as a doctor one day. Amal was very creative, she loved drawing. And she used to show me her drawings, and sometimes I would draw with her. Kenan was very playful – everyone loved him. And he used to take care of his little sister. He was always there to protect Rosa, and would say, ‘Don’t touch her, she’s my baby!’ And now they are all gone.” At the time of the interview, Khalil’s wife was being treated in hospital for her injuries sustained in the airstrike, and he was still searching for the body of his sister, Maysa.Where possible, Airwars has matched names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26thWhere sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The incident occured around dawn., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed11(6 children3 women2 men)Civilians reported injured1Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed11(6 children3 women2 men)Civilians reported injured1Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed11(6 children3 women2 men)Civilians reported injured1Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Images posted by Hosam Al Ashqar to Facebook show that the strike caused extensive damage to a residential building.Khaled Al Ashqar learned of his wife’s death and the injuries of his children while reporting live from Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. After hearing the news, he said on air: “Save us from the crimes of genocide. [Israel] is brutal and does not differentiate between anyone. My wife is not the first, so my cousin, her son, and her brother-in-law were with her…I lost the love of my life today.” Videos from Shehab Agency show Khaled Al Ashqar holding his injured daughter in the hospital as medics attend to her and a video posted by Khaled Abu Ahour shows Karam Al-Ashqar, another of Khaled and Islam’s children, crying for the loss of his mother.Islam Omar Al Ashqar and her four children had arrived in Gaza a few days before October 7th, to visit relatives. After the outbreak of violence, the family fled to Nuseirat refugee camp, which Israel had designated as for the displaced. However, a café and restaurant inside the Nuseirat Market was bombed by Israeli forces, according to Khaled Al Ashqar and Cairo24 News. A post from Hossam Al-Ashqar described the strike as hitting “the house of my uncle Abu Tariq Al-Ashqar”.A tweet from photojournalist @HosamSalemG gave condolences to his colleague Khaled Al-Ashqar and “thank God for the safety of his brother’s children, our colleague Muhammad Al-Ashqar” who was also affected by the bombing. A post from Omar Basher described Islam as “one of the kindest and most generous people”.Where sources identified a belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.Airwars was able to match Islam Omar Al Ashqar’s name to the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of names, October 26th 2023.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

Iman was killed with her son, 23-year old Ahmed Hussein Suleiman Abu Marahil and his wife, Duha Samir Al Haj Abu Marahil.The four deceased were confirmed by multiple local news outlets on Twitter/X, such as @F24online, @refugeesps and @palestine_graph. Each further reported that the airstrike also caused injuries to civilians who could be trapped under the rubble of the Abu Marahi family home, but did not provide a number of injuries.An outpouring of grief from the victims’ friends and extended family were expressed on social media. Facebook user Yasser Youssef remembered Issa Abu Marahil as a “sports captain” who was “one of the cadres of Ahly Nuseirat Club.” A photo attached shows Issa in a baseball cap and sports jacket. The Facebook page of Nuseirat Camp further remembered him as a “kind-hearted Hajj”, attaching a picture of him in a black three-piece suit.Facebook user Oday expressed their pain in a Facebook post and posted a picture of Issa Suleiman Abu Marahil (Abu Abdullah) dressed in black, smiling at the camera. A picture of his son Ahmed Hussein Suleiman Abu Marahil was posted alongside it, depicting the young man in a home, smiling brightly at the camera. Ahmed Hussein Suleiman’s wife Duha Samir Al Haj Abu Marahil and his mother Iman Salama Abu Marahil were also remembered in a Facebook post by Tarek.It is unclear how many others were injured in the strike. Facebook user Khaled Abu Marahil Abu Abdullah reported that “the whole family is under the rubble.” It is unknown whether the deceased were uncovered from collapsed buildings, or how many others remained.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

Airwars was able to identify 13 family members by name, including at least three women and four children. Dozens of other civilians were reported injured. Journalist Adel Zourub posted an image of the completely destroyed family home that used to belong to Adel Abdulaziz Hamad Dahleez.At 11:40 in the evening of Sunday Shehab Agency tweeted with a remark “urgent” that the body of a civilian and a number of other wounded people were delivered to Kuwait Hospital in Rafah after the strike on Dahleez family home. Since this first report, the number of civilians reported killed and injured on social media increased significantly. A Facebook user M. Hisham Al-Shaarawy reported about “11 martyrs and dozens of injuries.” Another Facebook user, Faris Al-Amour Abu Muhammad, mourned the death of his “dear friend Abdulaziz Dehliz and his entire family of 14 individuals.” Airwars has therefore estimated the upper toll as 15 fatalities. According to the post by Adel Ahmed, three members of the family survived the attack.Airwars has been able to identify 13 victims by name from eulogies posted by their families, neighbours, and loved ones, including posts by Abu Abdullah, Sahar Dahleez and Diwan Al Zaroub.64-year old owner of the house Hajj Adel Abdulaziz Hamad Dahleez was killed alongside his 57-year old wife Hiyam Fayed Mohsen Dahleez and her sister, 65-year old Sawsan Fayed Mohsen Dahleez (Aqla). Four brothers – a 31-year old Ziad Adel A Dahleez, a 33-year old Abdulaziz Adel Dahleez, a 22-year old Bassem Adel Dehliz, and 30-year-old Hamdi Adel Dahleez were also killed.Ziad’s 4-year old son Adel Ziad Adel Dahleez was also killed. Ziad was reportedly hugging his son when they died. There are also eulogies for Ziad’s wife, but Airwars has not been able to identify her by name. An image of the dead bodies of Ziad and his son Adel where Ziad is seen hugging his son were shared by Algeria News and Quranarab Facebook account.Among the victims of the deadly attack were also two of Abdulaziz’s small sons – a 4-year old Adel Abdulaziz Dahleez and a 6-year old Mohamed Abdulaziz Dahleez. A friend of the late Abdulaziz named Faris Al-Amour Abu Muhammad shared some images where Abdulaziz, a young bearded man in a yellow jacket, is seen embracing his two small smiling sons. In other images he appears at the seaside and at a family festival.Initially one of the relatives called “Lana’s Mother” on Facebook reported that Hamdi Dahleez and his wife were injured, and their names were not on the list of the killed relatives. However, later it was reported by Hamdi’s relative that Hamdi was in fact killed, though there were no further reports about his wife.Kamal Abu Aaed shared the list of 11 names and added some images of the victims, among them an elderly man, apparently Adel Abdulaziz Hamad Dahleez, and three young men who are apparently his deceased sons. The Zourab family, expressing the condolences to the surviving family members, also shared the same image of Adel.A 14-year old girl named Afnan Aladdin Ahmed Abu Younis was also among those killed and her father posted a photo of her phone background: a lantern with a Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad written.Lastly, Aseel Attia Dahleez was also killed as per testimonies of family members and friends.Muhammad Abu Hamdi wrote that “My cousin, Adel Dahleez, his family, and his grandchildren, are martyrs of Gaza”, sharing a graphic image of the dead bodies covered with cloth lying on the floor.The Shehab News Agency and SND News Agency both state that victims were taken to the Al-Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah. Photos shared by SND appear to show victims at the hospital, including a small girl sitting on a hospital bed. She appears coated in dust and with a look of shock on her face. Other images show a man being treated for a head injury, and another a covered body being taken to the hospital on a stretcher.None of the sources has directly attributed the strike to Israeli military. Airwars has matched the names of some civilians killed with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023, which explicitly mentions that names on the list are “victims of the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip”. Therefore, the strike status has been graded as a single source claim.

Safa News quoted the Ministry of the Interior in Gaza saying that a number of killed and wounded were recovered.Several news sources, including Al Jazeera, reported that several injured civilians were recovered from under the rubble and shared images of the house that appeared destroyed. According to Quds News, there were still wounded under the rubble the morning following the alleged attack. Facebook user Mohammed Ahmad posted several videos where many neighbors can be seen taking part in the rescue efforts on site.@ShehabAgency and Watan reported the death of Jihad Abu Taqiyya on October 31st as a result of the injuries sustained in the bombing.Umm Al-Abd Asma, Jihad’s wife, mourned her husband’s death in a deeply felt Facebook post, where she also described her experience on the night of the alleged strike: “We were sitting safely with our children in our homes. We found the house falling on us and was destroyed and turned into ashes. The house that I lived in for only two years after 16 years of torment, poverty, hunger, and deprivation.”She also shared details about the severe injuries of her children: “My daughter, Israa, had her leg amputated, my son Muhammad, his legs are platinum. Maryam still has not recovered from the operations. She came back and injured her legs, and every day she sleeps and wakes up screaming in pain😭.”A few days later she shared a video of her very young injured child on another post, where she wrote: “My son was in intensive care in Al-Shifa [hospital] for 13 days, and they took him out when they stormed Al-Shifa, and then they transferred him to Al-Rantisi [hospital], and Al-Rantisi was destroyed, while I and my son were there. He and I miraculously got out, and then I strayed from there to the Indonesian [hospital], and they also stormed the Indonesian, and we got out miraculously, and we were transferred to Khan Yunis, Nasser Hospital, and the situation was very difficult, all night long, with fire belts and terrible bombing.”Airwars was not able to reconcile Jihad Abu Taqiyya’s name with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of names, released October 26th 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The incident occured at approximately 7:56 pm local time., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1 – 2(1 healthcare_personnel)Civilians reported injured4Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1 – 2(1 healthcare_personnel)Civilians reported injured4Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1 – 2(1 healthcare_personnel)Civilians reported injured4Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Victims included 20 members of the Qadous family across three generations and at least four members of the Al-Derin Family.The patriarch of the Qadous family, Omar Hashem Qadous was killed with his wife, Ikram Qadous, and several of their children.

Another family member, Yazan Nidal al-Derini was also killed.Lower initial death tolls were reported in the immediate aftermath of the strike. Photos shared on social media depict ambulance and civil defence crews on-site rushing the dead and the wounded to the Indonesian Hospital for treatment. A young boy can be seen crying while receiving medical attention, and multiple other images showcase children in tears. Another image shows a confused-looking man gesturing while a doctor tends to a wound on his head. A very graphic photograph shared by Facebook user Medhat Muhammad shows a medic carrying a young girl into hospital; limp in his arms, her face and hair are completely bloodied. Images of the deceased were also included in the post: one shows the same girl laying on a bed next to a young boy, whose right arm had been severed. Another image, shared by user “Meet Basmala Muhammad”, showed a young boy who had lost both his legs in the strike.Confusion on the ground led to initial disparity in casualty figures. Shehab Agency and Al-Rased News initially reported 11 deaths and 27 injuries. East Now later reported at least 18 deaths and dozens of injuries. Friends and family on Social Media subsequently identified dead loved ones, bringing the casualties to at least 24. Facebook user Mahammad al-Madhoud reported a total of 30 deaths but this has not yet been verified elsewhere.Friends and family wrote heartfelt messages to their loved ones on social media.

The incident took place south of Wadi Gaza, where residents of northern Gaza had been ordered to relocate on October 13th, 2023.Amnesty International has identified the US-made Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), as the bomb used during the strike based on images of fragments of the munition found at the scene of the incident. Amnesty International weapons experts have estimated that the JDAM used weighed “at least 1000 lbs” and was likely manufactured in 2018.Dr Bakr Youssef Abu Muailiq posted to Facebook detailing those killed during the incident. His wife, 44-year-old Islam Majed Kamel Abu Muailiq, also known as Umm Ghanam, was killed along with their four children: Duaa Bakr Youssef Abu Muailiq (daughter, 16), Lama Bakr Youssef Abu Muailiq (daughter, aged 11), Muhammad Bakr Youssef Abu Muailiq (son, aged 13) and Ghanem Bakr Youssef Abu Muailiq (son, aged 14)The sister of Islam Abu Muailiq, Samar Majid Kamel Abu Muailiq, was also killed during the strike along with her five children: Rahaf Omar Youssef Abu Muailiq (daughter, aged 19), Raneem Omar Youssef Abu Muailiq (daughter, aged 17), Raghad Omar Youssef Abu Muailiq (daughter, aged 14), Sami Omar Youssef Abu Mailiq (son, aged 10) and Youssef Omar Youssef Abu Muailiq (son, aged 5).Shorouk Majod Kamel Abu Muailiq, the sister of both Islam and Samar, was killed with her three children in the airstrike: Souad Hossam Ibrahim Salem (daughter, aged 9), Aya Hossam Ibrahim Salem (daughter, aged 7) and Ibrahim Hossam Ibrahim Salem (son, aged 6). 48-year-old Youlia Nicola Abu Muailiq, who was reported to be a Russian citizen, also died during the incident along with her daughter Dr. Lina Sami Abu Mualiq who was 23 years old.The airstrike also killed numerous other members of the Abu Muailiq family including 22-year-old Kareem Yousef Salem Abu Muailiq and his 34-year-old brother Amar Yousef Salem Abu Muailiq, a 60-year-old woman called Raisa Abdullah Sulayman Abu Muailiq and Saheed Abdel Karim Mustafa Abu Muailiq, along with an unnamed woman referred to as the wife of Abu Ahed. The neighbour of the Abu Muailiq household – a 39-year-old man named Rajab Ghaz Mezyed – also died as a result of the strike.Amnesty International reported that 19 people were killed in the incident, however, Airwars has identified 23 names of individuals reported as killed amongst sources. In line with Airwars methodology, the minimum number of civilians killed is 23, as 23 names were identified. The highest civilian casualty count was reported by Duaa Jarghon, in a post on Facebook, who wrote that Umm Ghanem and 30 other members of the Abu Mu’eileq family had been killed.Amnesty International found no evidence that the homes of Abu Mu’eileq had any military purpose, or that Hamas was engaged in civilian ‘shielding’ at this location. The NGO described the strike as ‘unlawful’. Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, publicly announced that the incident was a ‘wake-up’ call for the Biden Administration into the role that US-made munitions are having in facilitating civilian casualties in Gaza.@Al-BusairsAbuAli posted a video to Facebook showing the aftermath of the airstrike. It shows civilians digging through the rubble of demolished buildings, and carrying the remains of those killed during the incident. It is claimed ‘dozens’ were killed during the strike. @ShebabAgency posted a video to ‘X’ (formerly Twitter) that showed the bodies of four young children that were killed during the strike. Their names had been written onto their bodies while they were alive so that they could be identified if they were killed.In an interview with Amnesty International, Dr Bakir Youssef Abu Muailiq – an ear, nose and throat specialist – said that he was working at the hospital when the airstrike that killed his wife and four children took place. Dr Bakr said there was no justification for the strike, and reaffirmed that his family was non-political: “we are doctors and scientists”. His statement aligns with Amnesty International’s assessment that there was no military objective to carrying out a strike on the Abu Muailiq households.Samaher Abu Muailiq, the brother-in-law of Islam, told Amnesty International that he left the building a minute before it was struck. He reportedly sustained injuries to the neck and the back when he was thrown against a door by the force of the blast. Survivors of the incident told Amnesty International that no warning was given.Since the incident, heartfelt testimonials have been posted online. @Abu Fares Ghareeb, posting on behalf of the “14 Million Conference”, commiserated the death of Islam Abu Muailiq and her children on Facebook, praising Islam’s kindness and good character. Islam was a member of the conference’s follow-up committee and the conference’s coordinator in the Gaza Strip.Wesam Waleed, a member of the Abu Muailiq family, described a “tiring and exhausting night” where he did not sleep due to his heartbreak.Amnesty International sent questions regarding the two attacks to the Israeli military’s spokesperson unit on 21 November.

Dareen survived along with her brother Kenan, but lost her parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts. In a video shared by user Nuha (devotedly.yours) on Tiktok, the injured Dareen was telling her story in tears. A small scar on her cheek and a large scar on her forehead could be seen.Dareen said that her mother, her father, both of her grandmothers and grandfathers Khaled and Anas were killed while they were staying in their house, and only she and her brother survived. She added that Israeli forces did not tell civilians to evacuate and bombed them while they were staying in the house.The attack also took the lives of the late Hanaa’s husband, Saher Saeed al-Sayed (29), his brother Ahmed Saeed al-Sayed (12), and the children of Hana and Saher, two daughters Najma Saher al-Sayed (3) and Maymouna Saher al-Sayed, possibly less than a year old.

Both girls have been described as under 18. His son Walid Hossam Walid Kabaja (possibly 8-9), and brother Abdul Aziz Walid Kabaja (possibly 18-19) were also killed. Hossam’s daughter, Roa Hossam Walid Kabaja (13) was reported as injured but due to the inclusion of their name in the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities, they likely died from their injuries. Izzeddin Khaled wrote his tribute to the late Hossam and his family.Izzeddin Khaled also mentioned his other cousin, Muhammad Muhammad Ahmed Bahr who was killed along with his three sons: Ahmed Muhammad Ahmed Bahr, Moamen Muhammad Ahmed Bahr, and Mahmoud Muhammad Ahmed Bahr, and his two daughters: Moslima Muhammad Ahmed Bahr (possibly 15-16) and Mona Muhammad Ahmed Bahr. All of them except Mona were under the age of 18. He also mentioned that Mona’s children were killed. Presumably her children were the two twin girls, Farah Hammam Youssef Bahr and Marah Hammam Youssef Bahr. Both girls were possibly under a year old.Among the victims killed were also four siblings: 7-year-old Malik Ahmed al-Shayah, Miral Ahmed al-Shayah, 5-year-old Nesma Ahmed al-Shayah, and Muhammad Ahmed al-Shayah.Social media testimonies mentioned a child Walid Anas al-Bayaa (possibly 8-9), Safaa Talal al-Bayaa (possibly 32-33) and a 56-year-old woman Amal Muhammad Ghulam al-Din al-Bayaa among the killed, and a child Areej Abdullah Salim Abdeen among the injured.Some of those killed were reportedly family members of Hamas Commander Abu Hamza al-Hindi who appeared to have been killed in a separate incident. In a photograph from Facebook user Maher El Sayed, he can be seen with a gun. Another individual, younger looking than al-Hindi, appears to be in police uniform. As this is not an indication of militant status, Airwars has not included a belligerent in our range – though we will update this should further information come to light.Airwars was able to identify the names of 47 people killed in the strike, however a post from Abu Ismail Al-Bayaa identified “more than 70 martyrs” in the attack on their uncle Khaled’s house. The upper casualty range has therefore been estimated as 71 fatalities.Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023. Other ages have come from the Shireen fatalities list; some of these specify different dates of death, though the names are exactly the same. In this case, ages have been marked as “possibly.” It is possible their deaths were discovered on this later date, or that they had been buried under rubble until then.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The incident occured at approximately 8:30 pm local time., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed48 – 71(24–25 children11 women12–13 men)Civilians reported injured3Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed48 – 71(24–25 children11 women12–13 men)Civilians reported injured3Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed48 – 71(24–25 children11 women12–13 men)Civilians reported injured3Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

There was no further reporting on whether Omar was killed or injured or survived unscathed, but his name was not found on the Ministry of Health list.Other members of the Abu Younis family who were killed include Zafer Ahmed Khamis Abu Younis (34), Asmaa Ahmed Khamis Abu Younis (26), and Taher Ahmed Khamis Abu Younis (39). Based on their names, it is likely that they were siblings of Shaima. A child named Sila Zafer Ahmed Al-Hams, likely a one year old based on the Ministry of Health list (but last name is listed as Abu Younis, which would likely make her the child of Zafer) was also killed.According to the Kuwait Specialized Hospital, Hamdi Ismail al-Zahar (40) was reportedly killed alongside eight-year-old Saqr Ahmed Ismail al-Zahar while another source mentioned that Hamdi’s son was also killed.

According to the post by Ahmed al-Naouq, American fighter aircraft F16 was used to conduct this strike.Ahmed al-Naouq, a media officer at the Palestinian Mission in the UK and a graduate student in London, lost around 30 family members in this incident according to his Twitter/X post that gained more than 6 million views. Airwars identified 21 members of his family killed based on Ahmed’s social media posts, including his 14 nephews and nieces. Condolence messages were offered to Ahmed on social media by his colleagues from the Mission, including the Ambassador Husam Zomlot, Rana Abu Ayyash, and Rami Abdu.In his interview to Associated Press, Ahmed recalled that that night when a blast struck his family’s home while he was in London, more than 2,000 miles away. He told AP that he left a question in his family’s WhatsApp group, “Tell me, how are you guys?”. He then heard from a friend: “Airstrike. Everyone killed.”Ahmed told AP in a moving testimony: “I can’t believe this actually happened. Because if I calculate what it means, I will be destroyed.”On November 15th 2023, Ahmed al-Naouq went to the British Parliament to talk to MPs about the incident in which Israel had killed his family. He asked them to vote for a ceasefire “to end the suffering of his people.”In comments to AP, Ahmed asked: “Why would they kill children and an old man? What is the military justification for bombing my house? They were all civilians. I wish, one day, I can meet the one who pulled the trigger. I want to ask him: Why did you do it?”Ahmed al-Naouq also recorded a voice tribute to his 14 nieces and nephews shared on BBC sounds under the title, “All I have now are memories”.Among the victims of the strike was Ahmed’s 75-year old father, Nasri Salem al-Naouq, his two brothers and three sisters with their fourteen children.Ahmed’s 36-year-old sister Walaa Nasri Salem al-Naouq was killed alongside her four children – two sons Raghad Muhammad Jamal al-Azayza (13) and Abdullah Muhammad Jamal al-Azayza (6) and two daughters Islam Muhammad Jamal al-Azayza (12) and Sarah Muhammad Jamal al-Azayza (9). The Associated Press report described the late Walaa Nasri Salem al-Naouq as “the most accomplished of the al-Naouq children with a degree in engineering.” Ahmed shared his picture with Abdullah and Sarah, adding that “this is Abdullah, when he was a bit younger. To the right is his sister Sarah. She was also killed. Sarah was born during the 2014 war. She endured the blockade and a number of wars since her birth.”His 35-year-old sister Alaa Nasri Salem al-Naouq (Salman) was killed along with her five children – daughters Dima Mahmoud Abdel Karim Salman (12), Tala Mahmoud Abdel Karim Salman (8), Nesma Mahmoud Abdel Karim Salman (2), Islam Mahmoud Abdel Karim Salman (13), and a son, Nour El-Din Mahmoud Abdel Karim Salman (4). A Facebook user Waseem Salman Abu Ahmed wrote in his tribute that the deceased Alaa was his uncle’s wife and shared numerous images of her smiling small children.Ahmed’s 33-year old sister Aya Nasri Salem al-Naouq lost her life together with the lives of her three children, sons Mohammed Bashir (12), and Tamin Bashir (6), and daughter Malak Bashir (aged 11 or 12). Malak initially survived the incident and was taken to al-Aqsa hospital with severe burns, but died “after doctors gave her ICU bed to another patient with a better chance of survival.” From a Twitter/X post from Ahmed al-Naouq on October 29th, it appears Malak died nearly a week after the initial strike.Aya was known for her “wry sense of humour.” According to the AP article, Aya’s home had been previously destroyed and she was staying with the others elsewhere in the central city of Deir al-Balah, south of the area Israel had ordered Palestinians to leave.Ahmed’s 35-year old brother Muhammad Nasri Salem al-Naouq was killed alongside his son Bakr Muhammad Nasri al-Naouq (11) and a daughter Basemah Muhammad Nasri al-Naouq (9). Ahmed shared an image of the dead body of Bakr, writing that “This is my brother’s firstborn. He was 11 years old.”Ahmed’s 25-year old brother Mahmoud Nasri Salem al-Naouq was also killed in this incident. Mahmoud al-Naouq worked at a human rights organisation and was preparing to travel to Australia for graduate studies when the war broke out. He was described by his former classmate, a Twitter/X user @Salahdeen Aziz Mattar, as “one of the best young men”. Similarly, Twitter/X user @Anas Mohammed Jnena described Mahmoud as “the loveliest spirit and the most kind and calm person one could ever meet.” In his Facebook post, he further reminisced how Mahmoud had told him how excited he was to pursue his master’s abroad and then get back home and get married. His brother Ahmed shared his image of a smiling young man in glasses.Among the victims was also Ahmed’s cousin, a 34-year old Ali Hisham Said Al-Quraynaawi, a PhD holder and a lecturer at a university in Gaza. Ahmed wrote in his Twitter/X account that he was killed in Ahmed’s family home and attached an image of a tall young man in a suit.Initially believed to have been a casualty, Aya’s son, Omar Bashir (3), was later discovered to be alive but injured. Described as “the little angel,” Omar was the sole child who survived the bombing. Ahmed wrote that “Omar is still living under bombardment. Omar is not safe.”A relative and neighbour of the affected family Ali Al-Naouq detailed his injuries, stating he “suffered a fracture in his left hand along with other injuries” when the al-Naouq house next to his own was bombed, resulting in significant damage to his residence. Additionally, an Associated Press report identified Ahmed al-Naouq’s sister-in-law, Shimaa, as a survivor of the incident, but it is not clear whether she was injured or not.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Where possible, Airwars has matched names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26th.The incident occured during the night., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed21 – 30(14 children3 women4 men)Civilians reported injured2–3Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducationImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

Together, they dreamed of a “beautiful future for their children.”The same report also describes Ismail’s brother, Muhammad, as “calm, balanced, and possessed of wisdom.” His wife Maria was an artist that “painted pictures that embodied a beautiful future full of love, beauty, and peace.” Their other brother, Wissam, had relocated to Turkey after a period of unemployment in Gaza before returning to settle down in Gaza near his extended family.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.According to a Facebook post from Youssef bin Mustafa Al-Buhaisi, the strike occurred without warning.Where possible, names have been reconciled with published Palestinian Ministry of Health lists.

Al Jazeera reported that the family home of Yahya al-Sarraj was severely damaged. Rushdi’s father Yahya al-Sarraj told Al Jazeera that the Israelis were bombing their area “with no let-up”.On the morning of October 22nd, Rushdi al-Sarraj tried to shield his wife and his daughter when the alleged Israeli strike hit their home. According to local news agency WAFA, a number of Rushdi al-Sarraj family members were transferred to Al-Shifa Hospital for treatment, though there was no clear injury count given among sources.The journalist was reportedly killed by shrapnel and was declared dead at the hospital. Ali Jadallah, a Palestinian photojournalist working for Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency, posted on Instagram the purported body bag of Sarraj, with his name on it, announcing his death.Rushdi al-Sarraj was a photojournalist who dedicated his life to covering Israeli attacks on Gaza. According to Le Monde, the 31-year-old worked for the press and international NGOs for over ten years, including with Le Monde. The French media outlet wrote that Rushdi was passionate about his land, where he was born, and where his family came from. Rushdi in interviews before his death described his early passion for photography, obtaining digital cameras despite restrictions on goods in Gaza. Rusdhi described how he and his friend, Yasser Murtaja, posted their first shots on Facebook in 2010. “We were filming the sea, gardens, markets. When people saw our videos, they were astonished. They didn’t know that Gaza could also be such a beautiful place,” Rushdi said in an interview in 2018.His father Yahya al-Sarraj told Al Jazeera that his son was a determined journalist and commented on his courage and bravery. His famous words were: “We will not leave. We will leave Gaza to heaven, and to heaven only.”His wife Shurouq, who survived the attack alongside their one-year-old daughter Dania, has also highlighted the importance of her husband’s work. “His legacy will live on” she told TRT World, “I’m honoured that he was my husband. I am very proud of him”.On November 6th, on the day of their daughter’s first birthday, Shurouq wrote a letter addressed to her deceased husband. “I am devastated,” announced Shurouq, “of the idea that our daughter will remain ‘close’ to Daddy’s heart without remembering his face. She is far too young to be orphaned, and I am far too young to be a widow. You were too young to lose your life simply for being a journalist”.An accompanying photograph to the letter showed Rushdi al-Sarraj and his daughter Dania smiling at one another in a comfortable home environment.A post by TwitterX user @Dr.Yahya Al-Sarra shared an image of Rushdi al-Sarraj and five children smiling into the camera – the caption reads “To the eternal gardens of my beloved journalist Rushdie.”Rushdi’s cousin Rajab al-Siraj wrote a Facebook post grieving his cousins death: “The martyrdom of the good cousin Rushdi Yahya Al-Sarraj. We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return. God is enough, and yes, the agent. Say hello to Yasser”In the wake of his death, tributes on social media were shared widely across the world that praised him as a friend and professional.Ain Media, the organisation cofounded by al-Sarraj alongside Yasser Murtaja, released a statement calling him a “brilliant photojournalist and film-maker”. “Rushdi and Yasser (photo-journalist who was also killed by the Israeli security forces in 2018) – are life” read the statement. “They gave voice to the people of Gaza, to their smiles, to the stories locked in fear, to hopes cherished secretly from the oppression of… Israel”.Similarly, Amnesty International, who worked with Rushdi al-Sarraj earlier on a short documentary that sought to shed light on the human cost of the August 2022 offensive on Gaza (‘They Were Just Kids’), paid tribute to his legacy: “We are devastated by the news that Rushdi Sarraj was killed in an Israeli airstrike”. The purpose of Sarraj’s work as described by Amnesty was to share stories from Gaza, not just stories of war and sorrow, but also simple and inspiring stories that people in Gaza share every day. “Rushdi is survived by his wife, Shurouq, and his one-year-old daughter, Dania, and by countless friends and colleagues who will continue to be inspired by his example and commitment to truth, justice, and hope”.Amnesty International Secretary General Agnes Callamard paid tribute to Rushdi al-Sarraj on her private Twitter/X account “We have lost a friend and colleague […] Rushdi was a talented filmmaker and a journalist – another victim of Israel bombing of Gaza”.​UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay released a statement where he condemned the killing of Rushdi and emphasised the need to reiterate UN Security Council Resolution 2222/2015, which protects journalists, media professionals, and related personnel as civilians during conflict situations. He has called for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death.Iran’s international news network – Press TV, Radio France International, Le Monde, TRT World, ABC Radio Melbourne also reported on Rushdi al-Sarraj’s death.Rush’s name has been reconciled with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of victims released October 26, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed air strikes to Israeli forces.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

Mustafa’s pregnant wife, 35-year-old Muna was killed, along with their children, 12-year-old Hala, Yousef and Taiseer. Mahmoud’s wife 31-year-old Maria was killed, along with their children (unnamed), as were Muhsen Abu Dan and Ahmad Mahmoud Abu Dan.Images of the funeral circulated on social media. Muna Qahtani shared the photos to Facebook, showing an outside memorial, with men and boys in prayer over 13 body bags. Images of the bodies being lowered into a grave, and the grave being covered with metal sheets, were also shared.Relatives and friends shared their grief online. Mona Barkat, a cousin of Jamlat, mourned the family and asked that “God accept them.” Mona further alleged that Muna was close to delivering her child: she was “pregnant and in a state of giving birth.”Many memorials discussed Ahmad Abu Dan, who was buried with his finger raised. A finger pointing skyward can be used while reciting the Shahada, Islam’s first pillar, and relatives were keen to emphasise this. Bassam Sherif posted a more poetic post on Facebook about his cousin’s death, writing that while “raising his index finger, he breathed out his last breath, and his soul left his pure body.” In the burial photographs, his pointed finger can be seen through a deliberate hole in his body bag.When sources identified a belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces. Libyan News Agency specified that the strike occurred without warning.Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.The incident occured in the morning., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed10 – 15(5 children3 women3 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed10 – 15(5 children3 women3 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed10 – 15(5 children3 women3 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

The residential apartments in Nuseirat Refugee Camp in the Central Gaza Strip were occupied when the bombing occurred.Airwars researchers have identified the names of five people who were killed and five people who were injured. Following the incident, friends and family took to social media to share the news of the incident. 23-year-old Maysaa Saadoun (Hamdan) and her one-year-old son Wadih Ahmed Hamdan were killed in the incident. A video posted after the incident shows Wadih’s grandmother, Umm Ahmed Hamdan, hugging her grandson’s bodybag following his killing. Wadih had recently tasted chocolate, she said, for the first time.Fidaa al-Lidawi was seriously injured in the bombing; according to a post by Facebook user Mahmoud Farajallah, Fidaa’s son, Muhammad Fidaa Al-Lidawi, sustained severe burns in the bombing, whilst Fidaa’s wife and daughter – 35-year-old Professor Rasha Muhammad Safi (Al-Lidawi) and 12-year-old Layan Fidaa Al-Lidawi – were killed in the incident. Sharing updates on Fidaa’s condition, friends and family shared photos and well wishes for his speedy recovery. Of these, many highlighted how Fidaa, pictured as a clown entertaining several children, was “the beloved of children and millions” who “drew the smiles and joy on the faces of children”.Following the incident, Facebook user Moataz Ali Abu Shawish shared the news that his father, family, and brother, Kamal Abu Ali, and his family were alive after “God saved them” from the bombardment. Another post by Facebook user Emad J. Abushawiesh clarified that Kamal Ali Abu Shawish, Kamal Ali’s family, and Emad J. Abu Shawish’s grandfather were moderately wounded with bruises and wounds.Dr. Adan Abu Amer sustained fractures and injuries in the incident. Adan’s son, Muhammad Adan Abu Amer, was also injured in the incident and was taken to intensive care, where his situation remained critical. Sadly, Adan lost his young grandson, two-year-old Jihad Khaled Abu Amer, in the incident. Months after the bombing, Jihad’s parents, Khaled Abu Amer and Nashwa Adan, posted tributes to their son, highlighting the difficulty of losing him. Writing on November 25, 2023, Jihad’s father, Khaled Abu Amer, remembered his son’s “sweet voice [which makes] my ears happy when you call me daddy.” Khaled and Nashwa had returned to their home the day previously, and the memory of Jihad was rife: “you, my beloved, are still present in my heart and my conscience.” In a post from January 25, 2024, Nashwa shared how she missed Jojo’s (Jihad’s) voice, the sound of his laugh, and how she missed playing with him and his cars. In February 2024, Nashwa remembered, “For three consecutive days before your [death], you were telling me how much you loved me.. I did not know that you were saying goodbye to me, and how could I know…”Five months after his death, Nashwa shared how losing her child on that day was “the most painful day she had witnessed in this brutal war and her life.”Kamal Abu Shawish shared a post on Facebook noting that two missiles hit the house. According to a post on Facebook by the Health and Community Return Association – Awda, 36 injuries, many of which were children, were taken to Al Awda Hospital, and 28 received care in the emergency department as well as the reception of the hospital; of these, 6 cases were transferred to the Al-Aqsa Hospital.

At least three members of the family may have been members of a militant group, though the evidence was unclear.According to witnesses, there was no warning prior to the bombardment.Wafa News also reported that a number of civilians were wounded. Twitter/X user MohammedArafa82 wrote that his uncle Abu Saeed’s house was bombed and levelled to the ground.Among those killed in the incident were 51-year-old lawyer Dr. Saeed Talal al-Dahshan (Duhshan) (Abu Hafs) alongside his 73-year-old mother Hooriyah Ibrahim Muhammad al-Duhshan, his 41-year-old wife Maha Ahmad Saleh al-Dahshan, and their 22-year-old son Talal Saeed Talal al-Dahshan.Dr. Saeed Talal al-Dahshan, dubbed a “young Malaysian,” for his time spent in the country; he was also an international lawyer who specialized in Palestinian affairs. Having obtained a doctorate in international law from the University of Islamic Sciences Malaysia, he published a book, “How to Sue Israel,” in which he outlined a legal strategy for “holding Israel accountable for its violations of international law,” as stated by Literary Hub. According to the post by Sami Salahat, Dr. Saeed al-Dahshan used to live in Malaysia in recent years. In some images he is seen surrounded by his students.A Twitter/X user Rima Naimoğlu (@filistinlirima) highly praised Dr. Saeed al-Dahshan, calling him “one of the distinguished international lawyers of Palestine, whom I set as an example for myself and see as my teacher.” On hearing the news of his colleague’s death, Twitter/X user @Ahmed Khattab shared a post stating that he had worked with Dr. Saeed al-Dashan to “monitor and expose the occupation’s human rights violations.” Ahmed wrote that now Saeed was “a victim of these violations.”Relatedly, Twitter/X user @Mahmoud Quassai Mokresh mourned the loss of a young Talal Saeed al-Dahshan, stating that he had “wanted to become a doctor abroad like his father.” Now, Mahmoud wrote, “in place of a Dr. [is] a martyr.” He shared a black-and-white image of the young Talal in a suit and a striped scarf.Saleh Alajarmeh wrote a Facebook tribute to the late Dr. Saeed al-Dahshan and his son Talal, sharing an image where both are seen in suits and ties at an event or conference. Mohammad in his condolence post also shared an image of the father and son and Saeed’s brother Muhammad.Saeed’s brother, 47-year-old Muhammad Talal Saeed al-Dahshan was killed along with his 38-year-old wife Ghada Faraj Is’haq al-Dahshan (Murtaja) and their five children. Their two sons: 18-year-old Anas Muhammad al-Dahshan and 11-year-old Qais Muhammad al-Dahshan, and their three daughters: 17-year-old Lana (Leena) Muhammad al-Dahshan, four-year-old Zeina Muhammad al-Dahshan, and 13-year-old Tala Muhammad al-Dahshan were all killed.Among the victims killed in the strike were also the sons and wife of Yahya Talal Al-Dahshan, according to the post by MohammedArafa82. One social media user mentioned Lana Yahya al-Dahshan, apparently his daughter, among the victims killed.Multiple sources referred to Dr. Saeed as a “Commander” and a “mujahid leader” – it is unclear if this is a reference to militant activity, given that these terms are often used in Gaza to refer to members of militant groups. It is also possible however that these terms were used descriptively to refer to Dr Saeed’s legal and academic efforts against Israel. Another source “Lawyer Mohammad Hasan Al-Dahshan Abu Moaz” also referred to Muhammad Talal Al-Dahshan Abu Anas as “the hard-working mujahid” and Talal Saeed Al-Dahshan as the “heroic mujahid”.Apart from these references, Airwars was unable to find other evidence online that would indicate they were members of any particular armed group, such as associated emblems belonging to militant groups or imagery with weapons of any kind. Their statuses as militants is therefore ‘contested’, with their casualties included only in the upper belligerent and civilian ranges as per our methodology.Following the incident, Saeed and Ghada’s son, @Hafs Said, shared a post stating: “And give good news to those who are patient. My dear father and mother, the apple of my eye and the mate of my soul, my brother Talal, with God’s permission and satisfaction. My uncle, my cousins, and my grandmother are beside their Lord, God willing. Our house was targeted without warning. They sat under the rubble of the house for more than 35 hours. May God have mercy on you, my beloved ones.”Where possible, names of the victims have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

Initially, most sources posted the names of 11 victims, but Bayan al-Saafin died of her injuries in November, several weeks after the strike.Samir Rajab al-Saafin (62 years old) and his wife, Fayza Hassan al-Saafin Younis (58 years old), were killed along with their son, Nasser al-Din Samir al-Saafin (13 years old), their daughter, Bayan Samir al-Saafin (age unavailable), their granddaughter, Hala Muhammad Samir al-Saafin (14 years old), their grandson (Hala’s brother) Amir Muhammad Samir al-Saafin (8 years old), and their granddaughter, Aisha Jihad Shaheen (less than one year old).Online, numerous loved ones shared their grief about those killed in the alleged strike. On Facebook, a surviving son of Samir and Fayza, Mohammad al-Saafin, shared photos of some of his relatives who were killed, including three children and a baby. Ahmed al-Saafin posted “My uncle Samir Rajab Al-Saafin, his wife, and several family members were martyred after their house was targeted.” Isaam al-Saafin wrote “House bombing Samir Rajab Abdel Hadi Al-Saafin. 11 martyrs so far.

Other accounts posted videos honoring various members of the family who were killed in the alleged Israeli strike.Eslam Nafez mourned Fayza Hassan al-Saafin Younis and her family, writing “My dear and affectionate aunt. My second mother, you left in the blink of an eye, two days ago, I saw you and hugged you. I did not know that it would be the last hug, my dear…My aunt Fayza, her husband, her son Nasser, and her grandchildren Amir, Hala, and Aisha, the daughter of Malak.

For days, weeks, and months, I waited for him to knock on the door of the house in which we were present and to surprise us with his arrival or his call to my mother to check on us, and in fact he came. Grandpa is for us, but only in a dream, and what is easy for us is that he came happy, with a cheerful face and relaxed….Not a single word could do justice to my grandfather, the poet, calligrapher, wise, compassionate, and kind grandfather, who used to come on our last summer vacation three times a day. He felt that he would leave soon, but we did not feel that. We were waiting for the hour when he would come and its timing. “Walak weno” accompanied his call to me, so I quickly went to the door, opened it for him, and was surprised by the bags of chocolate and fruits that we love, I asked him the usual question, “Is there tea or coffee?” Then he chooses what he wants, and I quickly run to prepare it, then I sit with him and tell him about the details of the university and my small achievements, and after that, he continues to encourage me for every achievement, applauds me warmly, and asks me to promise to keep the same approach, and he secretly tells me that his greatest dream at this age is to be happy with my graduation. From the university, but my grandfather left before witnessing my graduation.”Airwars has matched all the names except Bayan (who died after October 26th) with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, the strike was attributed to Israeli forces.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

An eyewitness interviewed by the New Arab alleged that their temporary home had been bombed “without warning” and stated that “there were a lot of children there.” This has led, the interviewee stated, to the feeling that “there is death everywhere in Gaza.”This incident has not currently been corroborated by other sources, and it is unclear whether the 32 alleged victims were killed in this specific strike.

Nablus TV reported that “a number of others” were also injured, but did not specify how many.Fadl Saqallah (49) was killed with his three sons, Dawoud Fadl Saqallah (17), Muhammad Fadl Saqallah and Majid Fadl Saqallah. Fadl’s brother Ahmed Saqallah (42) was also killed with his son Abdallah Ahmed Saqallah. Several other of Fadl’s nephews were killed, identified as 28-year-old Wael Mahmoud Saqallah, 15-year-old Ahmed Mahmoud Saqallah, 26-year-old Abdul Rahman Mazen al-Qishawi and 35-year-old Shadi Nahed al-Batta. Brother and sister Muhammad Ezzat Saqallah (18) and Maryam Ezzat Saqallah (33) were killed, along with their nephew Izzat Asaad Saqallah (1). Maryam’s husband, 40-year-old Hani Essam Saqallah was killed, as were their three sons: 11-year-old Muhammad Hani Saqallah, 7-year-old Issam Hani Saqallah, and Mustafa Hani Saqallah, who had not yet celebrated his first birthday.The Saqallah family arrived at the al-Batta family’s four-story house in Khan Younis after receiving evacuation orders. The Saqallahs, who own sweet shops in Gaza City, had arrived with trays of sweets for their hosts. The families sheltered together for approximately ten days, during which they shared “rare moment[s] of respite.” Along with the Saqallahs, the building was temporarily home to 100 displaced people.Speaking to Twitter/x user @Citizn YC, Ammaral-Batta, a cousin who survived the attack, said that the family thought “our area would be safe. But apparently, there is no safe place in Gaza.”Following the strike, friends and family wrote messages on social media mourning the death of their loved ones, and shared several images. Hani Essam Saqallah’s colleague and friend Sameh Mahfooz posted a photo of Hani wearing glasses and a short sleeve blue shirt sitting in front of a laptop. Hani was, Sameh wrote, “a symbol of morals, taste, literature, commitment, and kindness.”Shadi Nahed al-Batta was a 35 year old engineer who held a masters degree in Water and Environment and was the director of the central treatment plant in Khan Younis for the Coastal Municipalities Water Authority. Shadi was described by friends and family as young, ambitious and kind, “never refusing a request, and always ready to assist everyone.” Mohammed el Batta shared a photo online of Shadi standing on the steps with his two young children and his wife, to whom he had been married for eight years. One of his daughters holds a bouquet of flowers, while Shadi, wearing a grey suit and a blue shirt, embraced his wife as they smile toward the camera. @GazaMartys shared a comment from Shadi’s wife, which read ‘Shadi, you were a symbol of courage and sacrifice. You left behind beautiful memories for us from the 8 years we spent together with our small family.’Facebook user Mohammad Abuanza shared a selfie with Shadi by the side of a lake. Wearing hi-vis jackets, they smile toward the camera. The comment read, ‘fellow engineer Shadi Al-Batta, companion of difficult days and man of effort and ambition’. Shadi was aiming to study for a doctoral degree, and had received a passport to travel to a university outside Gaza before his death.In a photo shared on social media Fadl Saq Allah is depicted as a middle aged man sitting on a sofa in a beige shirt and grey trousers. His nephew Abdul Rahman Mazen Al-Qishawi is depicted in a standing pose wearing white trousers and a white shirt.In another photo, Muhammad Ezzat Saqallah is depicted as a young boy standing in a market, he wears glasses, a green and white striped shirt and a beige jacket.Middle East Page reported that the Saqallah family buried more than 50 of its family members in one day. In a video shared on Facebook a large group of mourners gather together as dozens of bodies wrapped in white body bags are carried out for burial. Pictures of the funeral show a blood-stained infant body bag, presumably holding the remains of Mustafa Hani Saqallah.Osama al-Bashity, a relative, reported that they couldn’t recognize the dead and could identify their remains only through clothing. Their relatives, al-Bashity stated, “had turned to pieces.” The family’s devastation, Ammar al-Batta said, was immense: “Our eyes are dry.

Imad Abdel Majeed Hashem Aslim (36) was killed, along with his children, son Suhaib Imad Aslim (13), Rima Imad Aslim (5), Osama Imad Aslim (2), and another relative named Noha Abdul Majeed Aslim (32).At least eight members of the Abu Odeh family reportedly died in the attack, including: Osama Hussein Abu Odeh, Khaled Fouad Abu Odeh (40), Aisha Fouad Abu Odeh, Nabaa Fajr Ziad Abu Odeh, Ibadah Muhammad Abu Odeh (14), Nevin Muhammad Abu Odeh, Lamy Muhammad Abu Odeh (16) and Abdul Rahman Osama Abu Odeh.

Al Ray Alaam reported that “16 citizens and a number of missing persons” had been killed in the bombing, while the Palestinian Information Center and sources on Facebook posts reported a range of civilians killed from 21 to 22. Twenty-two names have been posted by sources, which is likely due to the death toll rising as more people were recovered from under the rubble.It is unclear exactly how many people were injured in this attack, one source reported a large number of people were injured while Fawwaz Bahter reported that the attack had caused 50 injuries, in a post on Facebook.Imad Aslim was, according to Facebook posts from friends and family, a professor and deputy director general of the Emaar Association, a nonprofit civil association focusing on the development and rehabilitation of marginalised areas and groups of people in the Gaza Strip. One Facebook post also suggested that Imad Aslim was the founder of Fikra, a nursing home. A Facebook post from Yousef Khelfa wrote that they’d worked closely with Imad Aslim on projects to help children with hearing loss via cochlear implants. Yousef wrote that they had never met someone so dedicated to helping children, and said “He was a bundle of activity, humility, love, and benevolence to everyone who knew him and worked with him, sincere in his work for the children of Gaza.” Jamal Saleem posted “Yesterday, we bid farewell to a gentleman, one of the best men in the family, the best in morals, understanding, and sound mind, a first-class man whom everyone who knew loved him, with a pure heart and a sincere tongue.” Multiple Facebook posts from friends mourning the loss of Imad reported that his entire family were killed in the attack. Images of Imad shared by sources showed a smiling, middle-aged man, seen often with his children, and in one image celebrating their birthdays.Videos shared by Palestine Now and Saleh Amro showed the aftermath of the strike and rescue efforts, one seemingly soon after the alleged bombing with fires burning among the destroyed structure in darkness, the other during the daylight among the rubble.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli Forces.Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed22 – 25(11–14 children1 woman5 men)Civilians reported injured50Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducation,HealthcareImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

In line with Airwars’ methodology, ‘dozens’ is reflected in the 12 to 24 injury range.Social media tributes by family relatives and friends helped to identify the names of 11 victims. In a post on Facebook, Nouraldeen Abu Hilal reported the names and ages of the victims. 76-year-old writer Dr. Abdul Karim Eid Salama Al-Hashash (Al-Zahrani) was killed alongside his four sons and two daughters. 37-year-old son Qais Abdul Karim Eid Al-Hashash (Al-Zahrani), 25-year-old son Talal Abdul Karim Eid Al-Hashash (Al-Zahrani); 21-year-old AArabah Abdul Karim Eid Al-Hashash (Al-Zahrani) and 28-year-old son Al-Nadr Abdul Karim Eid Al-Hashash (Al-Zahrani) were killed along with 35-year-old daughter Hudham Abdel Karim Eid Al-Hashash (Al-Zahrani) and 30-year-old daughter Salma Abdel Karim Eid Al-Hashash (Al-Zahrani). The wife of Qais, Suheir Salam Jabara was also killed alongside their small children – four-year-old girl Arwa Qais Abdel Karim Al-Hashash (Al-Zahrani), one-year-old girl Alma Qais Abdel Karim Al-Hashash (Al-Zahrani), and three-year-old boy Athal Qais Abdel Karim Al-Hashash (Al-Zahrani). The brother of Suheir Salem Jabara, Anwar Jabara, mourned his sister in a post to Facebook, stating she was a nurse based at the Emirates Crescent Hospital. Anwar also confirmed that the young children killed in the incident, Arwa, Alma, and Athal, were the children of his sister Suheir and her husband Qais. Mohammad Ajbarah also mourned the death of Qais and his family, sharing his image of a young bearded man in a checked shirt.Al Bukhari Mahmoud also posted to Facebook to mourn those killed in the alleged strike, writing that his uncle, Dr. Abdul Karim Eid Salama Al-Hashash, was a renowned Palestinian writer. A post to Facebook by Bushra Al-Hashash, also a relative, confirmed Abdul’s writing profession and shared an image of him.In a further post to Facebook by Hussein Al-Hawari, an image of the late Dr. Abdul Al-Hashash was shared, with the caption paying respects to the deaths of the family. Dr. Al-Hashash, an elderly man with a grey beard, was captured wearing a black suit and a traditional Palestinian scarf against the backdrop of bookshelves.Airwars reconciled the names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023. However, the MoH list included the name Al-Zahrani rather than Al-Hashash. Given that other details matched, such as the first set of names and ages, the last name of the victims provided in the Ministry of Health list might be an error.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The incident occured in the morning., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed11(3 children3 women5 men)Civilians reported injured2–24Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactHealthcareImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

Accompanied is a picture taken during the day of a large smoke plume in the near distance.The Al nazle-nasr family Facebook page reported that the home belonged to one of the victims, the elderly Hajj Nasser Muhammad Saleh Abu Wardah (also known as Abu Muhammad), and reported that there were children affected by the alleged strike, which is corroborated by the other sources.In a post on Facebook, Mohammad Abo-Warda identified the names of those who were killed in the alleged airstrike and his relations to them. He stated that his father and his mother who are unnamed in the post had been killed. His parents were later identified as Hajj Nasser Muhammad Abu Wardeh and Raja Atta Abu Wardeh. He described his father as an “honourable… generous man with a beautiful character” and called his mother “beloved by all”.He also reported the deaths of his brother, 27-year-old Ahmed Nasser Muhammad Abu Wardeh, and his three sisters, ten-year-old Jana Nasser Muhammad Abu Wardeh, nine-year-old Sama Nasser Muhammad Abu Wardeh and Haya Nasser Muhammad Abu Wardeh. Haya’s daughter Sham Abdel Malek Abu Wardeh was also killed in the incident. Mohammad Abo-Warda’s cousins 16-year-old girl Dima Bashir Abu Wardeh and 34-year-old Madeleine Mahmoud Abu Wardeh were also killed alongside Madeleine’s daughter who was unnamed.Alongside his post, Mohammed shared five pictures of his family members, his parents, his brother Ahmed and young sisters, Jana and Sama, from before the incident. These images showed the family sat together, celebrating occasions like the arrival of a new baby and school milestones.The Abu Warda family Facebook account posted 12 names of their family members who were killed in the alleged strike. Some had been reported by Mohammad abo-warda, the other victims named were: 14-year-old boy Farouk Muhammad Farouk Abu Wardeh, six-year-old girl Sarah Tariq Bashir Abu Wardeh, and 47-year-old woman Nisreen Khader Abu Wardeh. It is possible that Sarah is the same child as Madeleine’s daughter.The Facebook page “Alnazla today” posted a list of those who had reportedly been killed in the alleged airstrike. In addition to the above names, the post identified one-year-old Masa Muhammad Youssef Nasr and four-year-old Faten Muhammad Youssef Nasr as killed in the incident. This source also added that Ziad Al-Muqayd (also known as Abu Muhammed) and his wife and children were reportedly killed in the alleged airstrike (named below).A Facebook user called Nadi y nser posted images of Masa and Faten from before the incident and referenced a victim named Mohammed saying, “may God heal you, O Muhammad, my dear brother”, suggesting that this victim may have been injured.Another Facebook user Mohammed Khaleel, shared a graphic image of the bodies of the young sisters Faten and Masa.Naheel Sai’d identified the names of Ziad Al-Muqayd’s wife Reham Shekhda Khader, two sons, 11-year-old Muhammad Ziyad Al-Muqayd and six-year-old Karim Ziad Al-Muqayed, and his daughter, nine-year-old Maryam Ziyad Al-Muqayd.

The picture is captioned “After three hours under the rubble, the child Mahmoud Abu Warda was recovered in good health”. There is no detail if the child received any injuries as a result of this reported airstrike, however the length of entrapment and difficulty in his rescue suggest that he may have been harmed.Safa, the Palestinian news agency, posted a video on Facebook of a boy named Raad Abu Wardeh, showing the moment he “was taken out from under the rubble of a house in the Jabalia Al-Nazla area”. In the video there are around 50 men at the scene assisting and watching the young boy, limp and covered in dust, being lifted onto a stretcher. No sources detailed whether Raad survived the incident or the extent of his injuries. The video also shows extensive damage to the side of the building and it appears the onlookers are standing on the remains of where a house once stood. It looks like at least two buildings have been impacted by this alleged airstrike.@mariagazali reported in a post on Twitter/X that a woman had been killed and others had been injured in a bombing that affected two homes belonging to the Abu Warda family.

The number of people identified to have been killed rose to ten as the search for missing people progressed. The minimum number of people killed has therefore been recorded as ten.Dr Yamen Jamal al-Astal, writing on Facebook, explained how Civil Defence Forces searching through the rubble had to pause their search on the evening of October 24th before all of those killed had been found, and return in the morning.Those named by family and friends on social media to have been killed in the strike came from three generations of the Abu Nasira family. 51-year-old Adel Muhammad Abdel Karim Abu Nasira was killed alongside his sister 56-year-old Amal Muhammad Abdel Karim Abu Nasira and her husband, likely 66-year-old Khalil Musa Abdel Karim Abu Nasira. Amal Muhammad Abu Nasira and her husband were grandparents.Amal and Khalil’s daughter 29-year-old Ghada Khalil Musa Abu Nasira and their son 38-year-old Musa Khalil Musa Abu Nasira were also killed.

The journalist Tareq Abu Ishaq also posted a video depicting mourners carrying the shrouded body of Adel Muhammad Abu Nasira through the street.Meanwhile, Abu Rami Abu Nasira posted an image and two videos on Facebook showing the scene of the strike some time after it had occurred. The images demonstrate that the strike reduced the Abu Nasira family home entirely to rubble. One image shows a sandy crater where the home once stood.The names of all identified victims have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26th.Amal’s husband was not named by open sources but has been deduced from the MoH list using the names of his children.Where sources identified a belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The incident occured in the evening., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed10(4 children3 women3 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed10(4 children3 women3 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed10(4 children3 women3 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Al Quds news agency shared an image of the bakery before and after being destroyed by the alleged strike, while Al Jazeera posted a video with aerial drone footage of the rubble and destruction, with the caption “The extent of the massive destruction as a result of the Israeli bombing (on) a bakery in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, resulting in the death of 8 people.” Al Araby TV posted a video of crowds gathered around the rubble of the destroyed structure, and heavy damage can be seen to the buildings near it. The caption stated that there were “a number of deaths and injuries.”Quds Press and Raya FM quoted the Government Media Office in Gaza, which announced the death of 10 individuals and the injury of dozens as a result of the alleged strike on “the only bakery of the Maghazi camp in central Gaza strip”, and that the bakery was “completely destroyed”, “a large hole was left in its place, in addition to the demolition of a number of houses surrounding the center of the camp.”Raya FM shared an image of a lone man sitting in dejection among the rubble. Attributing the strike to Israeli forces, the head of the media office, Salama Maarouf, was quoted as saying the bakery had been “supplied with flour hours earlier from UNRWA” prior to the alleged bombing. Facebook user Ahmed Salmi shared an image of the destroyed structure saying “many innocent civilians were killed and wounded” in the alleged bombing.Friends and relatives of those killed shared names of six of the victims on social media, which are as follows : 34-year-old Iman Abdul Rahman Younis Ali, her husband, 37-year-old Naeem Abdel Fattah Ali, and their sons, 15-year-old Saed Naeem Abdel Fattah Ali, six-year-old Ahmed Naeem Abdel Fattah Ali, 13-year-old Raed Naeem Abdel Fattah Ali, and 11-year-old Mohammad Naeem Abdel Fattah Ali.Family members posted messages on social media expressing their grief, often accompanied by photos of the family.

Shadi Ali shared an playful image of Naeem striking a pose, a middle-aged, bearded man with a shaved head.Aerial photographs shared by Gaza Days show the complete destruction of the bakery as well as extreme damage to the surrounding houses. Wattan News reported that the bakery was bombed “at a time when the demand for bread, the basic need for children to meet their needs, is increasing”, and that the bakery supplied bread to more than 80,000 people, and its destruction “puts them in a major dilemma in which the citizen cannot afford even a single loaf of bread.” They noted that “one of the citizens in the camp donated two clay ovens in order to alleviate people’s suffering, especially after the power outage and the inability of bakeries to provide the fuel and gas necessary to operate the bakery or even for citizens to make bread in their homes.”Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureHumanitarian aid distribution, IDP or refugee campCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed6 – 10(4 children1 woman1 man)Civilians reported injured12–24Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactFoodImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

However, a report published on November 8th 2023 by British news organisation the Guardian detailed how grandmother Samah al-Adini had lost her daughter, her son-in-law, at least two of her grandchildren, and the two paternal grandparents of those grandchildren in the strike. The minimum number of civilians killed has therefore been recorded as six by Airwars.Whilst no exact number of injuries was provided by any source, Safa, citing the Gaza Ministry of the Interior, reported that “several” had been injured in the strike, whilst @MAboAhmed95, writing on Twitter/X, placed the number at “many”.The Guardian’s report, entitled “‘Why didn’t we die together?’: the last survivors of three families speak”, written by Gaza-based journalist Wafa Aludaini, included powerful testimonies from Samah al-Adini and her six-year-old granddaughter Nai’emah, a survivor of the strike. Samah al-Adini, now caring for Nai’emah, said, “I remember my slain daughter. How can her little daughter live without parents?” She also explained that since the strike Nai’emah had not been eating, and as a result she wanted her to have access to therapy. “We will have to wait until the war ends, if we survive, to treat her,” she added.Aludaini further detailed Nai’emah’s recollection of the events, writing, “As Nai’emah sits in Aladini’s lap, she recalled how her mother was sleepy, but she knew Nai’emah loved fried potatoes so she cooked in spite of her fatigue. Her paternal grandmother was praying and her grandfather was listening to the news on the radio. The last thing Nai’emah remembered is that he called her and her siblings over to give them all something – a treat, maybe.

Mohammed Zorob also stated that three children were killed and all were brothers; this included Abdullah’s nephews Muhammad Ahmed Khalil Zorob (who was 8 or 9 years old), Abdullah Ahmed Khalil Zorob (who was one year old) and Bilal Ahmed Khalil Zorob who was four years old. Murad Zourob also reported on the death of 1-year-old Hamsa Bilal Khalil Zoroub, 12-year-old Hala Bilal Khalil Zoroub and another victim by the name of Hala Bilal Khalil Zoroub. Though similar in English, the names are spelled differently in Arabic; it remains possible, however, that this was a repeated name.The initial death toll was thought to be lower. Facebook user Ayoub Chemali first reported that seven victims had been killed and dozens had been injured in the incident. Another account, Awdeh plus+, initially reported that five people were killed and 16 people were injured.Family member Sherein Zourob, reported in a post on Facebook that many remained in critical condition and others were buried under the rubble. Magda Mahmoud reported in a post on Facebook that the four victims had been taken to Al Najjar Hospital following the incident and Mouaz Al Hamas shared a photo of the four victims, including at least two children, arriving at the hospital and being carried inside.Another hospital, the Kuwaiti Hospital, reported that a number of victims, both killed and injured, had been brought in following the incident. Kuwaiti Hospital also shared images of severely injured children being treated.A family member named Mahdi Zorob shared images on Facebook of the destroyed home and victims bodies being removed from the rubble. The caption reported that 11 family members had been killed.Images of the aftermath of the incident, taken by Fares Abu Sharakh, show the scale of the destruction. A large sandy crater can be seen alongside significant damage to the neighbouring buildings.Family members paid tribute to the victims and gave their condolences to Hajj Mahmoud Zorob, Salwa’s husband, and Abdullah, Islam and Fatima’s father, on the deaths of his family members. In a tribute post on Facebook, Baraa M Barhoom, described Abdullah Musa Mahmoud Zorob as an educator and mentor and attached an image of Abdullah from before the incident. Adel Zourob described Abdullah as being “dedicated to his family and people”.Though local sources including Sherein Zourob, Omer albargi and Mahdi Zourob reported on the Israeli bombing, many of the sources conflicted on the number of people that had been killed. The exception was Murad Zourob, who listed all 16 names. Journalist Adel Zourob stated the ages of the three children, @Hamzaalnamla tweeted images of the house that was destroyed and Ayoub Chemali post included a video of the scenes from the site of the bombing.Where possible, Airwars has matched names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26th.When sources identified a belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to the Israeli military.The incident occured in the afternoon., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed16(9–12 children2–5 women2 men)Civilians reported injured16Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducationImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

Her father, lawyer Hamada Mukhaimer, his wife, his daughters, and their relatives who came from Gaza to Rafah were also martyred. They were our neighbors in the Shaboura camp.” Attaching a picture of a smiling infant on a beach, Juma emphasized the child’s youth: “The photo is of Ali Alaa Nasr Abu Shawar, two-year-old…”Hamada’s daughter, Salma Hamada Mukhaimer, was known for her work as a freelance journalist. Following her death, @AidaAlami and @channeldraw tweeted that “[Mukhaimer], a freelance journalist, was killed alongside her child in an Israeli airstrike in Rafah city in the southern Gaza Strip.” Ms. Magazine reported the same information in an article titled “Reporting Under Fire: Honoring the Journalists Covering the Israeli-Gaza War.”Facebook user Wafa’ Abdelrahman shared a picture of the smiling Salma in a striped shirt and a pink hijab together with her husband and small Ali dressed in a matching shirt.

Uncle Hamada and aunts Amal, Iman, Fida, Muhammad, Ayat, and Musa. The house was filled with laughter. They are all lighthearted. I used to spend hours with them. Iman brings me coffee. Salouma prepares sweets so that we can eat them and reduce the bitterness of the coffee. My beloved aunt used to come and light up our seats…Only Salma and her family knew I was coming when I went to Gaza. They come to receive me from the crossing, and I stay with them and we plan together how I want to surprise my family. Salma was a sweet memory for me. Her room is a witness to our non-stop conversations. She used to say, “It’s enough for you to go, the dawn has come upon us.” Don’t you know, Salma, that I can’t get enough of talking to you? I’m trying to make the most of every minute of my short visit Many times when I used to come to you, your mother would say, “Are you coming to Gaza for Salma or for us?”…Salma is a piece of my soul. On the 18th day of the war on Gaza and hours before that, I sent her a message saying, “My heart is broken, Salma.” She told me, ‘me too.’…The house and the family are gone. Salma, her son, his uncle, his aunt, Iman, Fidaa, and Muhammad were gone. Ayat remained a witness to this calamity.”Ahmed Zohier Agha shared photos of Fathi Abdel Fattah Mukhaimer – known to some as “Abu Al Alaa” – and his son Alaa Fathi Mukhaimer standing near the sea, writing an obituary to the father and son: “The Mukhaimer family massacre: 17 martyrs.

Ahmed’s niece, 10-year-old Ghadi Mustafa Jamal Musa and her two brothers, ten-month-old Bahaa Mustafa Jamal Musa and 6-year-old Jamal Mustafa Jamal were also killed in the incident. Ahmed’s other niece, the daughter of his brother Hassan, Sila Hassan Jamal Musa (4) was also killed.Family members and friends of the Musa family wrote tributes on social media where they described their grief.Writing that he was “saddened by your separation,” family member Mohammed Mousa attached prayers for those he had lost, stating that “the eyes will shed tears and the heart will grieve.” Still, others comforted themselves with the belief that though their “hearts [were] squeezing in pain,” they had “soul[s] content with God’s will and destiny.”A Facebook account for the Basma al-Maghazi Elementary School, which the children attended, posted that they had “hearts torn with pain and blood over [the children’s] separation.” Though they were “not related by blood,” they “had a relationship of love and affection.”Muhammad Ahmed Musa was remembered as wise beyond his years: “his words must be heard when he was not more than 7 years old.” His sister, Alma, was remembered as “shy and beautiful,” and the infant Youssef was described as “always smiling.” Photos of the children, posing and smiling for the camera, were attached.Extended family member Aseel Mousa, writing for the Telegraph, had been displaced to al-Maghazi, and was temporarily residing near his family. He emphasized that there was “no prior notice, no warning, and no discernible reason for this assault.”The strike killed nine members of his family; all residents of the three-storey building. Hearing of the strike, Aseel rushed to the building, witnessing his father’s fear as he searched for family members. “I will never,” Aseel wrote, “forget the terror in my father’s eyes at that moment.”The time of the strike remains unclear.

Many shared religious messages stating, “And do not think that those who were killed in the cause of God are dead, but rather alive in the sight of their Lord, being provided for.”Many other posts thought of the family members left and asked that “God cover them with His vast mercy and to inspire those family members with patience and solace.”Where possible, Airwars has matched names with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of nearly 7000 victims’ names and ID numbers released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The incident occured at approximately 6:27 pm local time., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureReligious Institution, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed7(1–2 children1 woman4–5 men)Civilians reported injured7–10Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureReligious Institution, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed7(1–2 children1 woman4–5 men)Civilians reported injured7–10Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureReligious Institution, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed7(1–2 children1 woman4–5 men)Civilians reported injured7–10Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

At least five other family members sustained injuries in the strike. The family had moved following the Israeli military’s instruction on October 13th to move south for safety.Al Jazeera News reported that Wael Al-Dahdouh had been covering the on-going conflict from the Al Jazeera office and that Wael was surprised when he heard that Israeli attacks had taken place in the area his family were taking shelter in, as this area had been deemed safe by the Israeli Military. The family had been evacuated from the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood in the Northern Gaza Strip.Wael Al-Dahdouh’s wife, Amna Shaaban Ibrahim Al-Dahdouh (44) was reportedly killed, alongside their son, Mahmoud Wael Hamdan Al-Dahdouh (16) and daughter, Sham Wael Hamdan Al-Dahdouh (6), as well as their grandson, Adam Magdy Jaber Al-Dahdouh (45 days).According to an Al Jazeera news report, Wael Al-Dahdouh’s other children Sondos Al-Dahdouh (Adam’s mother), Kholoud Al-Dahdouh, Batoul Al-Dahdouh and Yehya Al-Dahdouh all sustained injuries but survived the airstrike, and were being treated at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Hanan Al-Dahdouh, Wael’s 81-year-old mother in law, suffered injuries to her hands and face.Siblings who were the daughter and son of Wael’s cousin, Ayman Al-Dahdouh (20) and Hadeer Al-Dahdouh (30) were both killed, along with Hadeer’s children Mayar Muhammed Amin Al-Dahdouh (9), Malak Muhammed Amin Al-Dahdouh (6), Mays Muhammed Amin Al-Dahdouh (4), and Majd Muhammed Amin Al-Dahdouh (1). In addition Amna Shaaban Jaber Al-Dahdouh, Lian Shaaban Ibrahim Al-Dahdouh, and Nidaa Shaaban Ibrahim Al-Dahdouh were also killed.In a tweet by @iirodeØ posted to X/Twitter, it was reported that Wael Al-Dahdouh’s ‘wife, daughter and son were martyred in one moment’.Al Jazeera’s correspondent said that there were more than 100 people in the building which was struck, including a large number of members of the Dahdouh family. The Guardian reported that the Health Ministry put the total death toll at 21 people. In a post to Facebook by Al Jazeera Palestine, it is also claimed that, alongside the Al-Dahdouh family, the airstrike also impacted members of the Awad family.During an Al Jazeera Egypt news report, reporter Hisham Zaquot narrated as footage of Wael Al-Dahdouh walking through the Al-Asqa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah to find his family members was broadcast.In a video posted to Facebook by Al Jazeera Palestine, Wael Al-Dahdouh can be seen crouched behind the body of his deceased son, Mahmoud, according to the video’s caption. The Qatari Al Jazeera network also broadcast images of Wael saying farewell to his son with a number of citizens gathered around him, offering their condolences.The Twitter account @wael333444 shared that Mahmoud Wael Hamdan Al-Dahdouh aspired to be a prominent journalist, like his father. PBS News reported that as Wael Al-Dahdouh wept over the death of Mahmoud, he said “You wanted to be a journalist”. Mahmoud studied at the American International High Street in Gaza, and according to his father, spent his spare time recording and editing video clips. In a video filmed by Mahmoud with his sister Kholoud and shared on Youtube, Mahmoud exclaimed that “This is the fiercest and most violent war we have ever lived in Gaza”. Both siblings stare straight into the camera to say “Help us to stay alive.”On the day of the incident, Mahmoud Hassan Al-Misrati shared a post on his Facebook account of watching Wael Al-Dahdouh broadcast live from a separate raid in the Gaza Strip moments before discovering the fate of his family, detailing that Wael suddenly cut off from the broadcaster. His voice, however, remained clear and he could be heard talking on the phone saying “Who is who?”.A post from Reham Abu Allan stated that 45-day old Adam Magdy Jaber Al-Dahdouh was the only child of his parents, and that his parents had been trying for four years to have children.According to an Al Jazeera news report, when Wael Al-Dahdouh’s daughter, Bisan Al-Dahdouh, heard that there had been an airstrike in the area where her family was sheltering, she headed to the Al-Asqa Martyrs Hospital. She recounted that “The first body I saw at the hospital was Adam, my sister Sondo’s first and only son.”.It has been reported that Amna, Wael’s wife, was preparing a meal when she was killed. Hasan Shoubaki described Amna and Wael’s relationship: “I have never seen a man as affectionate and close to his wife as Wael, and his dearest Umm Hamza was a homeland and a world filled with peace and affection. During his time in the operating room of the hospital in Amman, his lifelong companion did not stop praying for him.”According to a post from Hasan Shoubaki, four of Amna’s brothers had been killed by Israeli forces in years past, while Wael has lost two of his brothers to Israeli missiles in the past decade.Al Jazeera spoke with Ali Dahdouh, Amna’s brother, who said “Amna was my only and youngest sister. We are nine brothers and one sister. We live next to each other in Tal al-Hawa, southwest of Gaza City, and we all evacuated to Nurseirat after the Israeli orders. I used to have breakfast with Amna and her husband, Wael, every Friday. Our relationship was very strong.” Ali was not home when the attack occurred, and told Al Jazeera that his injured mother Hanan was unconscious and not yet aware that her daughter died, and that “My mother is very attached to her. It’s a big catastrophe.”Fares Ghannam posted a condolence message to his “childhood friend” Ayman, along with a picture of him smiling at the camera. Samah Dahdouh, sibling to Ayman and Hadeer, had returned home to Tal al-Hawa just a day before her family was killed. She told Al Jazeera that “They were all gathered at home, and now they’re all gone, my sister and all her children. I was on the verge of losing my mind. I couldn’t make it to the hospital from Gaza to Deir el-Balah at night. I arrived this morning. I couldn’t bid them farewell.” According to Samah, Ayman was engaged and was preparing for marriage when he was killed.Describing Wael as a colleague as well as offering his condolences, the account Documentaries2000 posted to Facebook a video compilation of Wael emotionally mourning a deceased young man and a deceased child. When mourning the young man, he is accompanied by a teenage boy who has sustained a head injury.According to CNN, the Israeli military has confirmed that they carried out a strike in the area, saying that they had targeted “the infrastructure of the Hamas movement” and @amanpour provided the same information during an on-air segment. However, “CNN cannot independently confirm the source of the blast at the house”.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

I don’t know what comes after this, whether new loss or relief.”An obituary for 51-year-old Dr. Ihab Muhammad Saleh Abu Hamda, posted by @J.darali mourned the loss of a generous son, brother, and husband. In the obituary, condolences were extended to Ihab’s sister, Professor Taghreed Abu Hamda, his wife, and his family as they dealt with “feelings of sympathy and pain on the martyrdom of their brother, their honourable and well-remembered son.” The obituary goes on to ask, “May God have mercy on him with his wide mercy, forgive him, pardon him, and grant him and all the martyrs of Gaza, the martyrs of Palestine, and the martyrs of the nation the highest paradise in Paradise.”In a Facebook post by Rafah.KhaldAlhasan, 41-year-old Muhammad Mazouk Qeshta was named as a further death from the strike. In the post, it was noted that Muhammad was “a member of the former area leadership,” and that he had been killed in his car when he was passing by the al-Shaer family home as it was being bombed. Regarding Fatah membership, as there has been no large-scale organised Fatah military presence in Gaza since 2007, and there is no additional evidence of militant status, Muhammad has been categorized as a civilian. Airwars will update this categorisation should further information come to light.A day after the incident, another casualty was identified as 22-year-old Muhammad Ihab Tawfiq Saad, who was found under the rubble of the al-Shaer family home.In noting all those who were killed, @Jales_tinian2 posted on Twitter/X that the al-Shaer family “bid farewell to 11 of its members” after the bombing of their family home. It was noted that this was “not the first tragedy for this family”.The spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health and Population in Sanaa (@alasbahi_dr) wished condolences to their colleague Dr. Muhammad al-Shaer on “the death of 11 and the injury of others from the al-Shaer family in Gaza, including his mother and brothers, in a brutal bombing”, making it likely that Dr. Muhammad was the son of Masouda al-Shaer.Images shared on social media documented the pain of surviving family members. An elderly man was pictured weeping as he is held up by relatives; another photograph shows mourners crouched over body bags. A further image shows a man looking at the uncovered face of a deceased friend or relative, covered in dust and blood, partially wrapped in a body bag.Sources indicate that the four-story family home was struck by “several missiles” without any prior warning. The residence was near Al-Istiqama Mosque and Awad Tower in the Al-Jeneina neighbourhood in Rafa, south of the Gaza Strip.Safa News and Wafa News reported that “others” were injured in the strike but did not specify how many. Those injured were reportedly taken to Abu Youssef Al-Najjar Hospital in the city.All names have been reconciled with published Palestinian Ministry of Health lists.

Two of Muhammad Ahmed’s nephews were also killed, nine-year-old boy, Adam Arafat Talal Abu Atiwi and a girl named Celine Arafat Talal Abu Atiwi, who was only seven years old.In a mourning social media post, Ibrahim Atawneh, Muhammad Ahmed Al-Atawneh’s brother, wrote: “Our entire house was bombed, including children, the elderly, men and women… I condole myself and my family with their martyrdom…” In the same post, he mentioned that several other members of his family were wounded: “My mother, my sisters, and the rest were moderately and critically injured. My big brother: Atta Al-Atawneh, his wife and children were injured”.Akram Qashlan, Muhammad Ahmed Atta Al-Atawneh’s father-in-law, also posted a farewell message on his Facebook account: “My daughter’s husband is a martyr, and we do not regard God as anyone Muhammad Al-Atawneh (Hamada) To the gardens of eternity, God willing”. The post included a selfie of Muhammad Ahmed holding a baby. According to a Facebook post by Muhammad Abu Al-Adnan, Muhammed Ahmed was a “beloved neighbor” and a “polite young man”, who was killed when their house was hit without warning.The user Rana Fathi Gharqoud posted a picture of the children Adam Arafat Talal Abu Atiwi and Celine Arafat Talal Abu Atiwi. She mentioned that she spoke to Adam the day of the alleged airstrike: “On the same day, Adam came to me and told me that he longed for Damascus and for the embrace of Damascus, a strong embrace”.

Sources did not indicate a specific number of either killed or injured civilians.A number of sources, including the Shehab News Agency, later reported that the body of one woman had been recovered from the apartment block that was hit.Videos posted on Twitter/X and Facebook, for example by Al Hadath Palestine, showed rescuers and medics approaching the apartment block, the third floor of which had been destroyed by the strike, covering the street below with rubble. The body of a woman reportedly killed in the strike is then carried by ambulance workers out of the apartment block and into an ambulance. The same video then depicts rescuers ascending the stairs of the building, possibly to search for more casualties.

An elderly couple Zakaria and Wahba lost their six children and fifteen grandchildren in the deadly attack.On October 26th Shehab Agency began reporting that a number of people had been killed in an “Israeli bombing that targeted the home of the Astal family in Khan Yunis.” Other sources including the Twitter/X accounts of @TVManar1, @AlGhadTV, and @AlMayadeenLive also reported on the rising number of casualties being retrieved from the rubble of the al-Astal home.A tweet by @hassaneslayeh quoted an announcement by the Ministry of the Interior in Gaza, saying “20 martyrs so far and a number of injuries in a bombing by [Israeli] aircraft on a house for the ‘al-Astal’ family in the western line of Khan Yunis, southern Gaza Strip.”At 9:21 PM on October 26, 2023, Twitter/X user @Alaqsavoice_Brk wrote that the number of civilians killed in the incident reached 39.Multiple videos shared on social media showed bodies of some of the dead shrouded in cloth. One clip shared by @Yahya_Alqassas showed a group of men carrying a body away from the site of the alleged strike. They are surrounded by piles of rubble on either side of the street. The accompanying caption describes “The Astal family massacre this morning. More than 20 martyrs. There are dozens under the rubble. The search under the rubble is still ongoing… There are more than 50 people in the house.” Videos of the funeral shared by @Mohamed94446649, Khaled Abdel Salam Abu Walid and others showed numerous shrouded bodies on a lorry bed, followed by a funeral procession and burial.Sufyan Akkad shared photos of multiple al-Astad family members, writing “a new carnage for the al-Astal family, and this is the result of the bombing of Abu Ali al-Astal and Abu Anwar al-Astal house, about 30 martyrs and there are people under the rubble”.Social media tributes by relatives and friends helped to identify the names of 39 victims of the deadly attack.

This has led Airwars to consider his combatant status as contested, reflected as 0-1 in our belligerent range.Zakaria and Wahba’s 34-year-old son Abdullah Zakaria Ali al-Astal was also killed in the attack along with his 25-year-old wife, Wafa Abdel Qader Ahmed al-Astal and their three sons: seven-year-old Yamen Abdullah Zakaria al-Astal, three-year-old Zakaria Abdullah Zakaria al-Astal, and infant Rayan Abdullah Zakaria al-Astal who was less than one year old.Zakaria and Wahba’s 36-year-old daughter, Alaa Zakaria Ali al-Astal and her husband, 37-year-old Hisham Hussein al-Astal were killed along with their 14-year-old son Riyad Hisham al-Astal and 11-year-old daughter Layan Hisham al-Astal.Yehia Z al-Astal shared a photo of Hisham Hussein al-Astal embracing his son, Riyad, writing “Tonight, we were saddened by another massacre against our family, in which entire families were killed, some of whom are still martyrs under the rubble.

May God accept you, my beloved,” and was accompanied by an image of the advertisement of the services provided by Radwan.The images of Ibrahim, Alaa, Radwan and Muhammad can be seen in a Facebook post by Layan Samer. These were shared alongside images of Nour Ibrahim’s small sons, Amir and Nermin, and an accompanying caption stated that “it is with great pride that the Loulah family mourns its martyred son, Ibrahim Radwan Loulah and his family, in the bombing in Khan Yunis.”Among the victims of the deadly attack were also 54-year-old Anwar Muhammad Ali al-Astal and his 19-year-old son, Bilal Anwar Muhammad al-Astal as well as two sisters, a 11-year-old Sama Salim Yassin al-Astal and two-year-old Ruaa Salim Yassin al-Astal.Among the victims killed in the airstrike was a 14-year-old girl Abrar Saleh Yusuf al-Agha known for her knowledge of the Holy Book Quran. The Nour Al-Islam Memorization Center of the al-Awda Mosque shared a photo of Abrar Saleh Al-Agha in a white hijab holding a certificate for memorizing the Quran, writing that Abrar “became a martyr today after the [Israeli military] committed a massacre that claimed the lives of dozens of martyrs.”The deadly attack also killed a small boy Abdul Rahman Muhammad Basman Saqr whose exact age is unknown. Saqr Famil Association Facebook account shared an image of the young smiling child in a khaki T-shirt, wriing “We ask God Almighty to cover him with His vast mercy and to inspire his family and loved ones with patience and solace.”Where possible, names have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.There were some discrepancies that have prevented a complete matching of certain names. Radwan Lawlah may be the 21-year-old Radwan Ibrahim Radwan Lawlah (ID: 408536233). The Gazan Ministry of Health list, however, specify that Radwan was female. The Radwan mentioned in this incident is male.Where sources identified the belligerent, the strike was attributed to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed38 – 39(20 children7 women11–12 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli MilitaryBelligerents reported killed0–1, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed38 – 39(20 children7 women11–12 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Belligerents reported killed0–1, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed38 – 39(20 children7 women11–12 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Belligerents reported killed0–1"

In an earlier Facebook post, Mohammed wrote that Joud was nine months old. The Gaza Ministry of Health alleged the infant was one. While Joud’s exact age is not specifically clear, it is evident from the photo that Joud was a young infant.Family and friends listed the names of those killed in the attack, while news sources reported many “martyrs and injuries.” Shehab News Agency wrote of the complete destruction of the four storey home in which the family lived. Nabd News referred to the scene as one of “massive destruction,” while posts on Twitter/X referred to the incident as a “massacre,” sharing photos of the four storey home and floors collapsed on top of one another. The Ministry for Interior also reported on the attack, again claiming there were multiple dead and wounded as a result of the alleged Israeli airstrike.There was widespread news coverage of the alleged Israeli attack, and in particular the death of journalist Nazmi Saadi Al-Nadim. Refugee SPS News wrote that Nazmi had continued to cover the events and report on the situation in the Gaza Strip even through communications blackouts.Many of the sources reporting on the death of Nazmi al-Nadim reported the incident and shared photos of the funeral on or after Monday, October 30th. However, on a Palestine TV livestream on October 30th, it was confirmed by Al-Nadim’s employers that he was amongst other journalists killed on Thursday, October 26th.Posts from co-workers and friends suggested that Nazmi worked at Palestine TV, with a statement written in English from the Committee to Protect Journalists, writing that Nazmi was the Deputy Director of Finance and Administration for Palestine TV.In the wake of Nazmi’s death, the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, according to Refugee SPS News, called on the Attorney General of the International Criminal Court, Mr Karim Khan, to open “an investigation into [alleged] Israeli war crimes committed against journalists.”Family members were also remembered in social media posts. Facebook user Huda Gh mourned her “dearest uncle,” Raed al-Banna and prayed that they received the “highest paradise in heaven.” Sobhi Safadi, also on Facebook, wrote that the death of his aunt Soha left “a great void in all of our lives.” She was, he remembered, a “second mother” who was “caring” and the “soul of the home.”Fawzi al-Nadim Abu Hamza, Nazmi’s nephew, wrote a Facebook post in which he remembered Nazmi as less like an uncle and more like a “big brother.” Fawzi loved “teasing” and “talking” with him. Fawzi also remembered Moaz, who he viewed as a little “cub.” Fawzi shared an image of the child from before the incident, holding up a certificate that described him as an excellent student. Enjoying staying close to his mother’s side, Moaz “came to embrace his father moments before the bombing.”Multiple candid photos of the smiling family were included, as were selfies some of the children had taken. Photos posted by multiple sources showed members of the Palestinian press walking through the streets carrying a shrouded body and a bloodied press vest.The deceased were reported to have been taken to Al-Shifa Hospital following the strike.Some sources reported that a house belonging to the Abu Dayya family was also destroyed in the incident – this may be the same house although images of the incident showed multiple buildings with severe damage.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to the Israeli Military.Where possible, names have been reconciled with published Palestinian Ministry of Health lists.

Meanwhile, the Palestinian Refugees Portal news website placed the death toll even higher, reporting that 44 bodies had been recovered from the rubble following the bombing of al-Shati camp.Those identified to have been killed in the strike came from at least three generations of the al-Ghoul family.63-year-old Majed Muhammad Mahmoud al-Ghoul was killed alongside 66-year-old Najah Khaled Salem al-Ghoul (reportedly his wife), his two sons – 35-year-old Amjad Majed Muhammad al-Ghoul and 28-year-old Muhammad Majid Muhammad al-Ghoul, his three daughters – 42-year-old Maysaa Majed Muhammad Al-Ghoul, 32-year-old Hana Majed Muhammad al-Ghoul and 29-year-old Israa Majed Muhammad al-Ghoul, and at at least four grandchildren.In particular, the strike killed three small children of Amjad Majed (grandchildren of Majed) – nine-year-old daughter Rahaf Amjad Majid al-Ghoul, four-year-old daughter Maryam Amjad Majid al-Ghoul, and two-year-old son Majid Amjad Majid al-Ghoul. One-year-old daughter of Muhammad Majed, Karima Muhammad Majid al-Ghoul, was also among the victims.46-year-old Muhammad Ibrahim Hassan al-Ghoul was killed in the strike alongside his 20-year-old son Sami Muhammad Ibrahim al-Ghoul, and his three daughters – 22-year-old Sally Muhammad Ibrahim al-Ghoul, 17-year-old Sama Muhammad Ibrahim al-Ghoul and 12-year-old Sandy Muhammad Ibrahim al-Ghoul.38-year-old Sami Nafez Muhammad al-Ghoul was killed along with his children – 14-year-old son Nafez Sami Nafez al-Ghoul, and 15-year-old daughter Malik Sami Nafez al-Ghoul.Among the victims of the deadly airstrike were also three siblings – 40-year-old Fatima Zaki Mustafa al-Ghoul, her 62-year-old sister Heshma Faryal Zaki Mustafa al-Ghoul, and 52-year-old brother Shawqi Zaki Mustafa al-Ghoul.Shawqi al-Ghoul, in turn, was killed along with his three children – 20-year-old son Abdullah Shawqi Zaki al-Ghoul, 26-year-old daughter Israa Shawqi Zaki Al-Ghoul and 30-year-old daughter Nagla Shawqi Zaki al-Ghoul, and his grandchildren – four-year-old son of Nagla Muhammad Omar Nafez al-Ghoul and eight-year-old daughter of Nagla, Fatima Omar Nafez al-Ghoul.Another pair of siblings – 45-year-old man Fadi Mahmoud Abdel Qader Al-Ghoul and his 47-year-old sister Jamal Mahmoud Abdel Qader Al-Ghoul – were also killed.Grandmother Amal Mehdat Abdel-Gawad al-Ghoul (age unknown) was killed alongside her 34-year-old son Ayham Ahmed Haroun Arif and her 11-year-old granddaughter, daughter of Ayham Amal Ayham Ahmed Arif.34-year-old Walaa Majid Muhammad Arif al-Ghoul was killed alongside her two daughters – nine-year-old Amal Falasteen Ihab Ahmed Arif and Siwar Ehab Ahmed Arif (age unknown).Finally, the list of victims also contained the names of 29-year-old man Nour Aed Zaki al-Ghoul and Wafa Dhaif Allah (Ghoul) (age and gender unknown).Images of the names of victims hand-written on paper were shared by multiple local sources.Shehab News Agency reported on Twitter/X that “dozens” of those killed and wounded in the strike were transported to the al-Shifa hospital, whilst Nader al-Ghoul, writing on Facebook, indicated that 18 people were left trapped beneath the rubble of the building in the aftermath of the strike. None of the sources provided a specific injury toll.Local sources reported that the strike occurred amidst an extremely intense bombardment of the al-Shati camp. Al-Arabiya News reported that their correspondent described how al-Shati had been “witnessing the heaviest bombing since the beginning of the war, stressing that it is an unprecedented bombing at sea, land and air.”Meanwhile, the Palestinian Wafa News Agency published a report with a number of testimonies from people in the camp, including from the scene of the strike on the al-Ghoul family tower block. 54-year-old local resident Alaa Mahdi told reporters that Israeli strikes on al-Shati were like “an earthquake, even more violent than an earthquake. If it had been an earthquake, it would have been less than what was caused by the naval, artillery, and aviation bombardment.” He also noted that internet and telecommunications were cut off prior to the beginning of the strikes which caused “comprehensive destruction”.The Wafa report also describes the scene of the destroyed al-Ghoul residential tower, noting that surrounding homes were also destroyed by the airstrike. Dozens of people were seen searching the rubble for survivors and victims, with one young man Abdul Majeed Abu Hasira lying on his stomach calling down into the ruins: “Is there anybody under… we are here to save you.”Zakaria Baker posted a number of photos on Facebook depicting the completely destroyed tower and heavily damaged surrounding buildings, with numerous people appearing to be searching the rubble. He also paid tribute to those killed, offering “our full solidarity and sympathy to our neighbours, friends, and loved ones, the al-Ghoul family”.Another image posted by Mohamed al-Ghoul on the al-Ghoul family Facebook group showed at least twelve bodies, wrapped in white sheets, laid on the ground in a street.Nader al-Ghoul also paid tribute on Facebook to those killed and offered his condolences to those who had also lost family members, noting that this was the second time a large number of al-Ghoul family members had been killed in strikes. He wrote, “My condolences to the loved ones, my uncle Abu al-Walid’s house, my uncle Abu Amal’s house, and especially Abu Nizar Mohieddin, whose wife lost her family” in the first incident. He added that he was listing the names of those killed “because we are not numbers.”Where possible, the names of the victims have been matched with the Palestinian Ministry of Health list of fatalities in Gaza released on October 26th, 2023.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.Whilst the precise local time of the strike is unclear, an Al-Ghad news report referencing the incident appears to have been posted on 27th October, whilst the first report with an exact timestamp was posted by the Shehab News Agency at 01:04 local time on the morning of 28th October.

However, as more information came to light, the names of those killed were released. Among those named were mother 28-year old Ikhlas Muhammad Abu Mohsen and son Uday Abu Mohsen as well as Umm Ahmed Abu Mohsen and her daugther Baraa Abu Mohsen. The exact number of injuries is unknown.Uday Abu Mohsen was scarcely a day old when he was killed along with his mother, Ikhlas Muhammad. Friends and family took to social media to mourn the death of the pair. Among those who posted online, Facebook user Maya Basim highlighted how eagerly Ikhlas had awaited her son’s arrival, meticulously preparing their home with all the essentials, from clothing and bedding to carpets and paint. Rewaa Zaher, sister of the deceased Baraa, wrote that Ikhlas “was excited to see him and give him a safe birth.” They would both be killed, Rewaa asserted, before Uday was ten hours old.Palestine TV emphasised that Uday had “not yet had a birth certificate issued,” and instead received a death certificate. Images of his body bag, tagged with his name, were released.Another tragic loss befell the family in the aftermath of the incident: Umm Ahmed Abu Mohsen and her almost 31-year-old daughter, Baraa Abu Mohsen, both passed away days later due to injuries sustained. Their story gained attention through Al Jazeera, revealing that Baraa, a vibrant artist renowned for her intricate cake decorations, left behind her seven-month-old daughter, Tamara. Before the conflict, Baraa, described as “more compassionate and kinder than all of us” had also been pursuing a diploma in Project Management–after she successfully gained funding from an NGO.Initially a student of English, Baraa began decorating cakes “by accident.” Inspired by pictures she saw on the internet, Baraa learned how to decorate pastries even when she did not have the proper tools. In such cases, Rewaa remembered, she would make them herself out of “common household ingredients and paint [the cakes] by hand.” The war had been highly impactful on Baraa’s life. Baraa’s sister Rewaa remembered that her sister was “afraid every time she heard bombing.” It was not that Baraa was concerned for herself, Rawaa wrote, but that she was “afraid for Tamara.” Baraa’s birthday was fast approaching, and Rawaa hoped “to give [her] a big surprise.”Adding to the tragedy, Baraa had urged her sister, Rawaa, to bring her own children to the family’s home, deemed safer in Gaza, just a day before it fell under attack.

A family member, Waleed al-Majdalawi, declared that in addition to the 26 members of the family who were killed, 11 people were still under the rubble. Similarly, Shehab Agency reported that in addition to the 26 recovered, 10 bodies remained under the rubble following the incident.An urgent Facebook post from Ashraf al-Husseyni al-Khaleel reported that 30 people had been killed as a result of the strike.All of the identified victims were members of the Al-Majdalawi family. Ages provided by the Ministry of Health differed slightly from the ages provided by the Shireen list. Of the 20 people identified as killed by family members on social media and through a private source, at least five were women and seven were children.Mahmoud Hassan Mahmoud al-Majdalawi, 25 or 26-years-old, was killed, as was his 56 or 57-year-old cousin Abdul Karim Fathi Abdul Karim Al-Majdaalawi. Abdul Karim’s wife, who remains unnamed, was killed, as were four of his five children: 26 or 27-year-old Fathi Abdul Karim Fathi Al-Majdalawi, Muhammad Al-Majdalawi, 28-year-old Basma Abdul Karim Fathi Al-Majdalawi and 29-year-old Ilana Al-Majdalawi, whose age is unknown.Several children were also killed: 14 or 15-year-old Wissam Ziyad Fathi al-Majdalawi, 17-year-old Nada Ziyad Fathi al-Majdalawi and 13 or 14-year-old Ahmed Ziyad Fathi al-Majdalawi, who were likely a set of siblings based on their names.

Shortly after arriving home, the neighbouring house, which belonged her uncle, was reportedly hit by an airstrike, collapsing onto her family home. Mirvat’s brother 11-year-old Ahmed Mohammed Youssef Al-Majdalawi was killed in the incident alongside many other relative who were in the affected homes. The private source reported that Mirvat’s father 36 or 37-year-old Mohammed Youssef Abdel Karim al-Majdalawi was also killed in the incident.According to the private source, Mirvat said that she was buried under the rubble for a few minutes, her leg and hand visible. Once rescued from the rubble, Mirvat had sustained visible harm to her right cheek and left ankle. She may have broken her leg in multiple places but the source was not certain.The source further explained that Mirvat was taken to Al-Shifa Hospital to be treated and was transferred to the European Hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip in mid-November following the Israeli Military campaign on Al-Shifa Hospital.She was then taken to stay with an aunt in Rafah. Her two other brothers, three-year-old Omar and Youssef who is in Grade 1, survived the incident and were also placed in the care of relatives.The extent of the destruction caused by the incident on October 27 was captured in video and online condolence posts. A video shared by Twitter/X user @2Elhob shows a mother making entreaties to the camera, clearly in distress.A post on Facebook from Falastin Tanani expressed wishes for their cousin “Ayat and her three children” who had been killed and were now “in the hospitality of the Most Gracious.”A condolence post from Facebook user Dina Mofeed described Basma and Ilana Al-Majdalawi as her “neighbors and childhood friends.”Much of the remembrance, however, came from family members Amir al-Majdalawi and Waleed al-Majdalawi. Amir, Abdul Karim’s sole surviving child, studies medicine in Algeria. While he has received his medical certificate, it appears he has not yet started working as a doctor. His father’s dream was “to see him as a doctor” and would proudly refer to him as “Dr. Amir.”Amir described Basma, who had turned 28 less than a month before her death, in a Facebook post. An Arabic teacher at an UNRWA school, Basma had studied the language at Al-Aqsa University and had passed her employment exams with a 97% mark. Eager to learn more, Basma had started another Bachelor’s degree in Islamic Sharia at the Hamouda Institute. Amir described her as “the first in her class.” Very interested in Islam, Amir remembered Basma would speak about the Quran as she walked around the house, quoting Hadiths she found particularly beautiful. She hoped, Amir wrote, to get a Masters degree in Islamic rhetoric. Amir further remembered how much Basma loved Nescafe and Torku chocolate, “coffee and books” and “knowledge and the pen.”Mahmoud al-Majdalawi was said to have “loved fishing,” and enjoyed his life with “a lot of fun and laughter.” An avid bird hunter and raiser, Mahmoud had built a small hut to take care of his birds. He was “not only loved by his family, but everyone who knew him loved him and testified to his good character.” His brother Waleed al-Majdalawi posted a picture on Facebook of Mahmoud with his two-year-old daughter, Amira, and lamented that he would never be able to see her grow up, which was “his only dream.” Waleed remembered him as “mischievous,” “cheerful” and loved by everyone.Where possible, names have been reconciled with published Palestinian Ministry of Health lists.

The precise number of victims remains unknown and the victims have not yet been identified.CNN reported that the victims were from several families who were taking shelter in houses around the site of the mosque after they were displaced from northern Gaza. Survivors of the attack reported that they woke up to see buildings collapsing and had received no warning of an attack. One survivor, Issa al-Ahmad, reported being lifted out from the rubble. Though Issa survived, his mother and sister were killed. Mohammad Ahmad, another survivor, reported that at least three families who were sheltering near the mosque were killed. The strike, Mohammad stated, occurred while people were sleeping: “We were sleeping and all of sudden the glass and rubble were on top of us from every hole, we were terrified.” There were no warnings, Mohammad claimed: “We didn’t know exactly where the hit was, we started running to get our children out.” The confusion and fatigue was palpable: “Where are we supposed to go?”Yasser Haweij, an eyewitness quoted by Al Jazeera Mubasher, emphasized the fear sparked by such attacks, claiming that in Gaza “there is no safe place.” Haweij corroborated CNN’s claim that surrounding homes were housing displaced people: “many families were displaced here in response to the warnings of the [Israeli] government, but even these areas are no longer safe, as missiles and explosive barrels reach them day and night.” Despite limited infrastructure, Haweij stated that volunteers “were able to rescue a number of children and women trapped under the rubble.” Because of power outages, volunteers were unable to reach the Civil Defence, and brought the victims to hospitals themselves. From the rubble, he alleged, they uncovered a pregnant woman, children, and an elderly woman.Multiple videos were shared on social media showcasing the destruction wrought by the strike. A video shared by Facebook user Ahmed Nofal shows a toddler being removed from under rubble. It is unclear whether the girl, who is limp in a volunteer’s arms, is alive. Another video, shared by the same user, shows a child uncovered from the rubble being placed in a car; the child appears deceased. Another infant is seen with a bloodied head. One civilian screams as they remain beneath the concrete.In an image shared by PNN Network, a group of young children are depicted standing on the rubble looking at the victims’ destroyed belongings: furniture, notebooks, clothing and rugs are amongst the debris.Images shared in various news sources depicted the acute infrastructural damage caused by the attack, which completely collapsed the mosque and a number of nearby homes.A video, shared on Facebook by public broadcasting cooperation Arabic TRT depicts the aftermath of the attack. People can be seen wandering around the decimated area where the mosque once stood; the area is now covered in rubble. The surrounding houses are either damaged or completely destroyed.

Others, including Marwan Zaloum, who posted on Facebook, emphasized the civilian efforts being made to search for survivors under the rubble. In a video shared by multiple sources, a group of volunteers can be seen searching the wreckage of the completely destroyed building and removing a person who appeared to either be dead or injured. No identifying factors have been publicly revealed.A second video, also shared by Marwan Zaloum on Facebook, showed a rescuer repeatedly shouting down into the rubble asking if anybody was alive and listening for a response from potential trapped survivors.No detail of civilian harm was provided by sources beyond that shown in the video – where it is unclear whether the individual being removed from the building is injured or killed – and the repeated references to survivors being trapped beneath the rubble. The casualty range for both injured and killed civilians has thus been recorded as 0-1.

The son of Zuhair and Hanan, Yousri Warshagha, referred to Ghalia as his grandmother in a post on Facebook; she is likely to have been the mother of Zuhair or Hanan.Hanan’s brother, 46 year-old Iyad Lafi Warsh Agha was killed along with this three sons, 17-year-old Ahmed Iyad Warsh Agha, 13-year-old Ayman Iyad Warsh Agha, and 9 year-old Louay Iyad Warsh Agha, and his two daughters, 19-year-old Ghalia Iyad Warsh Agha and 15-year-old Ghazal Iyad Warsh Agha. 27 year-old pregnant woman Mona Zaher Warsh Agha and her son, Ahmed Murad Warsh Agha (age unavailable), were also victims of the deadly attack.Yousri Warshagha also mourned a number of family members, writing “And give good news to those who are patient and who, when a calamity befalls them, say, ‘Indeed, to Allah we belong, and to Him we shall return.’” He grieved his “dear” father, and emphasized that his mother Hanan was “the apple of my eye and the soul of my heart.” In his post, Yousri shared photos of some of his family members, including a child.20 year-old Muhammad Hani Nabhan Warsh Agha was one of the victims of the strike. On Facebook, Manar Warshagha shared painful details about his brother Muhammad’s death and the aftermath of the alleged strike that killed him. Manar was “filled with tears and I am saddened by [Muhammad’s] absence. May God give patience to my family with the loss of an entire family.” He prayed that “God [would] have mercy on him, Muhammad Hani Nabhan Warsh Agha.” To Manar, Muhammad was “the best brother and friend.”Manar wrote of Muhammad’s wish to be killed at home, were he to die. It appears Muhammad was trapped under rubble– he sent “a message saying that I was living under the rubble, but unfortunately the message did not arrive until late due to the interruption of the Internet and transmission from Gaza and the equipment was not available.” Manar’s family searched for remaining relatives trapped under rubble; most of Manar’s family “thank God, until the end of the praise, […] arrived fine.” The strike, Manar stated, exemplified “the sad story of Gaza.” Writing the post, Manar said, was something done “with my pen and with my sadness.” He attached several photos of a smiling Muhammad.44 year-old Dr. Nidal Rajab Mahmoud Warsh Agha was killed alongside his son, Murad Nidal Rajab Warsh Agha (possibly 11-years-old). Fahed Warshagha honoured his relative, Nidal Warsh Agha, by sharing a photo of Nidal posing in a suit at his desk, along with a caption stating “With the highest levels of pride… the Warsh Agha family mourns Al-Shahi / Dr. Nidal Warsh Agha Abu Osama Warsh Agha.

With the martyrs, and your abode is Paradise. Palestine TV correspondent Majid Ahmed Kashko is a martyr.” According to cousin Nader Kashko, “[Majed] had a beautiful disposition and a calm personality.

He is always optimistic …May God have mercy on you, brothers, martyrs, God willing, you, your wife, and your 8 children.” A heartbreaking post by Nader Kashko from November 12 says “Raed Ahmed Kishko, my twin brother, friend of childhood and youth, companion of life and path. Goodbye, my love. Goodbye, my twin brother. Goodbye, my friend. God knows how much I suffer from your separation. I will never forget you as long as I live.” Nader also shared a slideshow featuring smiling pictures of Raed.On November 5, Rami Ahmed mourned Mahfouz Hashem Kashko, his wife Iman Fathi Muhammad Abu Safi, their sons, Tamer Mahfouz Hashem Kashko, Khaled Mahfouz Hashem Kashko, and Ihab Mahfouz Kashko, along with other victims of the incident. Rame described Mahfouz as being very well know in the area, “He worked in the civil defense and public works crews, and they knew his good manner and he liked all people, and his eternal good conduct will remain forever.” Rami also described his mother-in-law Iman as a “second mother” and wrote, “The true meaning of the word sugar is in her tongue: remembrance and praise, her love for people, and her humility.” Rami also wrote tributes to each of his cousins, writing “Tamer, my brother and my childhood friend, and the stages of my life until I became his brother-in-law […] Praise be to God, my communication and our love did not cease during the brutal war. By God, they are in my heart and they were my second family […] #Ihab, the ambitious, educated, confident, courageous young man with sweet attitudes. May God accept you and your son among the martyrs. #Khaled, the owner of the sweet laugh, the sweet sitting, the sweet talk, and there is no problem in life for him. […] #Ahmed Al-Khadoum, the gallant man who does not have a word “no” about anything, he helps and does not upset anyone because of his big, kind heart, ambition and spontaneous thinking. He is loved by everyone.” The post features photos of many of the Kashko family members who were killed in the alleged strike, including a number of children, and also shows pictures of various family celebrations with gifts and children’s birthday cakes.Three months after the strike, Muhammad Majid Ahmed Kashko (Mohamed Abo Majed on Facebook), a surviving son of Majed Ahmed Hashem Kashko and Sherihan Anwar Al-Ashi Kashko, shared photos of many of his deceased family members on Facebook and described his loss, writing “all members of my family were martyred in a brutal [Israeli] raid that targeted us in our safe house, which led to the martyrdom of my entire family and a fracture in my spine.” On June 16, he shared a photo of dozens of his family members with the caption “Kashko Family Massacre 30/10/2023” and wrote “this Eid, I am filled with sadness and pride at the same time. Parting from my loved ones who martyred for a noble cause is a weight that cannot be lifted, but also a light that lights my way.”Rami Ahmed also shared his continued grief months after the strike, with a Facebook post on the first day of Ramadan 2024 writing “Ramadan Kareem, and may God have mercy on my father, my mother, my brothers Majid and Raed, their wives, my brothers’ wives, their sons and daughters, my wife, and my five sons [more than 40 martyrs] And my uncle, Abu Tamer, and his wife and dear sons, Tamer, Ihab, Khaled, and Ahmed, and their wives and sons.

He opened the door to the wedding hall he owns next to his house and tried to provide them with a place to sleep, rather than having them sleep on the streets. However, the [Israeli military] did not approve of this, and they committed a heinous crime that led to dozens of killed and injuries.”Further underlining the connection between Israel’s forced displacement of residents of northern Gaza and the casualties of this alleged strike, the article quoted Ahmed Abu Hamada, saying “Haj Abu Iyad [al-Hayawi]…opened the doors of the wedding hall he owns to [civilians] seeking shelter…after UNRWA schools became overcrowded and unable to accommodate tens of thousands of displaced people.” According to Abu Hamada, “on Monday afternoon, Israeli aircraft bombarded the [Tal al-Qamar] Wedding Hall and the surrounding houses with an incendiary belt, resulting in dozens of casualties, all of whom were children, women, and civilians. The owner of the hall and his son were also killed.”Following the alleged Israeli strike, numerous loved ones shared their grief online.

Asma Rabah honored “the beloved of all of our hearts and the companion of our souls in the mosque and memorization circles, Waseem Tamraz’s mother, May God have mercy on you, my love, and accept you, your husband, your children, and the love of my soul, Rima. Our hearts hurt, my love. We were shocked by the news, I swear… We bear witness to God that you were the best sister and memorizer of the Book of God and keen on memorizing the flowers of our mosque.”A few days after the strike, Ahmed Teem shared photos of Samir and his son Hossam and Omar Abu Hamda‎‏ shared another nice photo of Hossam.

May God have mercy on her, O Lord, and grant us patience and patience with her separation. Anwar Abu Shanab, Umm Abdullah al-Hato Suhad Anwar.”The attack and its aftermathAccording to witness Ahmed Farajullah, “I was shocked by a violent bombardment…I rushed to the scene and was among the first to arrive at the site of the bombing. The atmosphere was terrifying, and the remains of children and women were scattered everywhere.” Explaining how he and others initially handled the aftermath of the alleged strike, Farajullah described how “the large number of Palestinians killed and wounded, and the extensive bombardment forced us to provide first aid and evacuate the bodies and casualties using civilian vehicles. We would place 3 or 4 bodies and injured individuals in a single car and transport them to the nearby Return Hospital. This hospital would deal with simple cases and transport the bodies and the critical and moderate cases to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.”He also described in horrific detail having “to retrieve [body parts of women and children] from the trees and from under the rubble.” Another surviving relative, Ahmed Tamraz said, “The Israeli [military] killed all the members of my uncle Samir’s family and my uncle Misbah’s family” and “that everyone…who lived in the house, worked in trade, and they were all civilians.”A video posted on Facebook by Press Abeer Albanna revealed the extent of the destruction of the wedding hall and adjacent residential buildings, showing a large crowd gathered at the site which appears to be covered in debris. Photos posted by Arabi21 News, the Federation of Arab News Agencies (FANA News), and Jawhara FM showed significant damage to infrastructure as well. A photo tweeted by @crazymanforever showed two people assisting an injured man onto a stretcher at the still-smoldering site of the alleged strike, with press and emergency workers visible in the background.In a poignant post, Fatima Jaber shared her reflections about the alleged attack on the Tal al-Qamar wedding hall and the surrounding community, writing “today’s massacre reminded me of the Tal al-Qamar hall in the Yarmouk camp…This hall witnessed my wedding and a very large number of those who attended the ceremony, including friends and family, left this life without me being able to take a last look at them and say goodbye to them…The Tal Al-Qamar Hall in the Palestinian Yarmouk Camp in Damascus was bombed…but the memories remained. ”Where possible, names have been reconciled with published Palestinian Ministry of Health lists.

It is unclear whether injuries occurred directly from the strike. While Shehab Agency said civilians were wounded, MSF reported “no patients were harmed.” The strike nevertheless put great strain on the hospital and patients’ well-being, ultimately reportedly resulting in the death of four patients who did not receive life-saving care due to the strike.Sobhi Skaik, the Director General of the hospital, lamented that the strike “endangered [patients’] lives by targeting the hospital surroundings.” This, he said, augmented the pain caused by the war generally, which had “increased the suffering and pain of cancer patients and deprived them of medicines and travel for treatment abroad.” Others on social media grieved the human cost. Twitter/X user @Aywa_anaBen0a mourned that “pregnant women, the elderly, children, and even cancer patients were not spared.” Amongst those in the hospital, “a state of panic” was widespread. Hospital workers were made to “evacuate patients from the upper departments and secure them in the basement to preserve their lives and protect them.” At least seventy cancer patients were “seriously threatened.” Reuters, quoting the Gazan Health Ministry, said that four patients later died due to the hospital being out of service.Local and international media companies such as Anadolu Agency, Al Mamlaka TV and Alghad TV reported on the bombing. AA News claimed that the strike destroyed both the third and top floor of the hospital, both of which provided care for cancer patients; it is the only hospital within the Gaza Strip able to provide such treatment. Al Arabiya News, quoting journalist Khader al-Zaanoun, alleged that the third floor had entirely collapsed because of a strike-induced fire. The bombardment also caused electromechanical systems to malfunction.The Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital is one of the largest hospitals in Palestine with an area of 34,800 square metres, three floors, and 180 beds; it also functions as a training center for medical staff. Sources alleged that Israeli forces struck the hospital multiple times: reports published by Quds News, @Refugeesps and Alghad TV indicated that Israeli forces repeatedly bombed the hospital. Fajer TV claimed that this strike was the second.The strike triggered condemnations from abroad. The hospital, supported by Médicins San Frontieres, was built in 2017 with “a generous donation from the Turkish government.” Accordingly, Director General Skaik urged the Turkish government to “protect this humanitarian medical edifice, which has constituted an important transformation in the care of cancer patients in the Gaza Strip.”Al Jazeera Turkiye reported that Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca announced that following the reported Israeli bombings, Turkey would take “necessary measures to continue its services at the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital.” His statements were censorious: “those who bomb everything that moves, even the vicinity of the hospital, must prepare themselves to be held accountable for this before the court of conscience.” Turkiye’s Foreign Ministry also condemned the strike, which they did “in the strongest terms.” There was, the Ministry wrote, “no explanation for such an attack.” The Times of Israel quoted the Turkish Foreign Ministry as saying “all necessary information, including the coordinates of the institution in question was shared with the Israeli authorities in advance.” Turkiye was, sources suggested, “ready to take in cancer patients” from the hospital.On November 1st, the World Health Organization (WHO) in their Twitter/X post also commented on the alleged strike, posting that “the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital is no longer functional due to the lack of fuel and the damage that was caused by the Israeli airstrikes in its vicinity over the past 48 hours.” They consequently “called for sustained access at scale for humanitarian aid – including fuel, water, food and medical supplies – into Gaza,” and for the “active protection of civilians and health care.”Multiple sources shared videos and photographs documenting the moments of the bombing. @TVManar1, @uzisal and Refugeesps on their Twitter/X and Facebook posts shared a video documenting the moment the Israeli military allegedly bombed the vicinity of the Turkish Friendship Hospital. Alghad TV, as part of a live broadcast, shared a video showing the hospital and its surroundings covered in smoke, causing panic among the public.The Turkish Palestinian Friendship Hospital shared images showing the damage caused by the bombing, along with an overcrowded hospital floor crowded with patients.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed air strikes to Israeli forces. When asked for comment by CNN, the Israeli Military stated that “The IDF did not strike Gaza’s Turkish-Palestinian Friendship hospital.” It did not offer any further information.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureHealthcare facilityCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed4Civilians reported injured0–2Causes of injury / deathDenial of access to/destruction of objects indispensable to survival, Heavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactHealthcareImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

Shortly after that, friends and family members mourned hia death on social media.On November 29 family relative Mahmoud Abu Shawish wrote that the family was not able to bury Mahmoud, as Israel forces allegedly prevented the access to his body.Mahmoud Anwar was described as a young “distinguished entrepreneur” and “ambitious person” who co-founded the Tawreed Company.

The house belongs to the Hamdan family, and it included displaced people from the al-Maqousi and al-Bakri families, who were displaced from the northern Gaza Strip.” According to @klaib94, they had “fled from Shati RC” (al-Shati Refugee Camp). On Twitter/X, multiple sources, including @ShehabAgency, Snd News Agency, @Quds_feed and @YouthGoDigital reported “the arrival of 14 martyrs to al-Aqsa Hospital after the bombing of the Hamdan family’s home.” According to the Nuseirat City Facebook page, the house belonged to “citizen Adnan Hamdan.”Online, mourners paid their respects to those affected by the alleged Israeli airstrike.

You were always with Tita, and you ended up going with her and you also took some perfume with you.” She had not yet, Reema wrote, congratulated her Aunt Maryam on her new home. “Oh God, oh God,” Reema lamented, “give patience to our hearts.”Alaa H Al Maqousi offered “Our condolences to my cousin Mahmoud Nasr Al-Maqousi, ‘Abu Al-Walid,’ on the martyrdom of his wife and son, Ibrahim, and his good-natured mother-in-law, Umm Al-Abd Al-Maqousi, her daughter, and his uncle’s wife, Umm Wissam Al-Maqousi.” Facebook user “Butterfly of Love” prayed, “May God have mercy on you, my friend and lover, Suha, and have mercy on al-Maqousi, and have mercy on your mother, and have mercy on the rest.” Every one of the displaced, she wrote, had died. Because of the strike, all “my loved ones and friends are gone.”The uncle of some of the deceased, Garam Mohamed, mourned the deaths of “My sister’s children Rasha Zuhair al-Bakri (Dakka), Habib Zuhair al-Bakri and Majed Alaa Abu al-Jidyan.” He prayed for “God [to] have mercy on them and grant them peace.”Images included with sources show multiple blood-stained body bags, two injured children, and a man whose face is covered in blood.It is unclear whether the casualties were caused by an airstrike or artillery.

Al Jazeera, along with other news agencies such as Shehab Agency and the Quds Network, claimed that people were resorting to transporting the injured on animal drawn carts due to the fuel crisis in Gaza.However, Facebook account, Qadaya Al Ummah claimed that the animal-drawn carts are necessary because the Israeli military will bomb “anything moving in the streets, including medical crews and ambulances”.Video footage shows at least one man who had been injured by the strike, but the identities of the civilian victims is not known.When sources identified a belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee campCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killedUnknownCivilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killedUnknownCivilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killedUnknownCivilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

These details were found through open sources as well as testimonies provided to Airwars, which enabled Airwars researchers to identify 62 children – another five individuals are assumed to be under the age of 18 based on descriptions and referenced by sources. In some cases ages were not found exactly but are assumed based on pictures provided by sources.All ages where known have been included below and otherwise individuals have been listed as ‘children’. Where only names were identified without ages, Airwars counted these as adults. Airwars has included an upper range of an additional ten children, to account for references in witness testimonies to body parts of children seen in and around the area.Dozens of others were also reported injured, including at least three women and three children. Most of the victims of the strike were women and children. Reports put the strike at around 2:13pm.Airwars was able to identify many of the victims through testimonies provided by surviving relatives, including individuals like Hisham Joyfel who lost his mother and his seven children in the attack, Magdy Saleha, who lost his wife alongside five daughters, and Mustafa Muhammad Al-Hanafi, who lost his wife and four children.According to Asma Shaheen, the Engineers Towers – consisting of at least 20 residential apartments – was attacked with multiple “missiles”, according to the source, and completely flattened. Pictures posted on social media showed piles of rubble where the building used to be. A Twitter/X user @AlHadath reported in a video that around 200 civilians used to live in the Engineers Tower, quoting the building keeper. According to user Sahat on Facebook, 45 people were killed, among whom were “some of the tower’s residents” who had been forcibly displaced from the North of Gaza.On Twitter/X, @AJA_Egypt showed a video of the location of the incident, with a journalist explaining that the tower was completely destroyed in the bombing and that no warning was given to the residents.The journalist Osama Al-Kahlot explained in the video that efforts to rescue victims stopped at night due to continued heavy bombardment, but started again in the morning on November 1st.Several sources, including Palestinian information center (@PalinfoAr), journalist Osama Al-Kahlot, and Twitter/X user @hassaneslayeh, initially announced more than 45 “martyrs” from the Engineers tower bombing. Twitter/X user @ajmubasher, referring to sources from Al Jazeera Live, claimed that dozens were killed and injured from the attack, while Safa News wrote about “a large number” of killed and injured civilians.Twitter/X user @Bashar_Hamdan and NGO “Friends of the Global Campaign to Return to Palestine” later counted 50 killed civilians, dozens injured, and dozens still missing under the rubble.Witness testimoniesOn November 1st, Al-Hadath correspondent (@Alhadath_Brk) announced that about 200 civilians were still buried under the rubble and missing from the attack. As the status of these civilians is yet unknown, Airwars has not accounted for these victims in our casualty range – though we will update our assessment should more information come to light.Based on obituaries published on social media by relatives referring to a number of civilians killed from a specific family unit without information available regarding their identity, as well as to account for the unnamed victims of the attack in media content archived, Airwars has ranged the number of civilians killed between 133 and 164. A video reportage from @AJA_Palestine included testimonies of witnesses of the airstrike. An elderly man said that there were many residents in the building, and it was suddenly bombed by three Israeli missiles. He added: “My son was going to the market to buy bread, and now we don’t know anything about him. We didn’t expect the building to be bombed.” The reportage also showed a woman who was crying and said that the building was full of families, and entire families died. Another reporter said that there were 30 people inside the building and rescuers could not get them out. He alleged that women and children were attacked on purpose.In reportage by Syria TV (@syr_television) correspondent Shorouk Shaheen, a young man who witnessed the strike said that suddenly four missiles landed on the building, and body parts of children were flying in the air. He added that engineers and doctors used to live in this building, and nobody expected they would be bombed by Israeli forces. The report said that the bodies of 25 children were recovered from the rubble, and approximately 25 still remained trapped. “My sister, sister’s husband and their children are still under the rubble,” he said at the end.An elderly man said that he had gone down the street, 300 meters away, and saw parts of the bodies of young girls. He added that the “Israeli military is bombing us, they think we are their enemy. But we are civilians.”One more man featured in the report lost his three sons. His sons aged 17, eight and nine years old were playing soccer when they were killed in the attack.Injury estimatesMost of the sources reported a “large number” or “dozens” of injured civilians from the attack, many of them children.ShehabAgency explained that “a number of martyrs and injured” of the Al Muhandeseen bombing were taken to AL-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. Twitter/X account @Times of Gaza shared images of injured children in a hospital, with some severely injured and in need of life support.Abo Suhaib and Amal Abd Dura released pictures of civilians being treated by medical staff – some of them directly on the floor in an overcrowded hospital. Sahat Media showed on Facebook a video of several children injured in the attack, lying in what seems to be an ambulance, including a girl talking to the journalist.Mayar Al Khatib published images made by Walid Musleh of the civilians killed and wounded: an injured man on stretchers, an apparently wounded (or killed) infant and an injured teenage boy.Airwars identified the names of six civilians injured including three women and three children. As no sources provided specific information on the number of civilians injured, Airwars has ranged this number between 12 and 24 given the references to ‘dozens; among sources (as per our methodology), and will update its estimates once more information is known.Rescue effortsThere were many videos and images published by local sources showing scenes of victims and survivors being pulled from the rubble. @EekadFacts posted a video on Twitter capturing at the scene of the bombing, a young boy being rescued from the rubble. Similarly, @AJA_Palestine recorded the moment where a young girl, injured, was rescued and carried away in a man’s arms. @AJArabic published an aerial footage of the place of the incident, showing ongoing rescuing efforts.Striking images taken by Hani Abourezq/Al-Hayat Al-Jadeeda and posted on Facebook by Alhaya News showed rescue efforts amidst piles of rubble. One man was pictured while he was trying to listen to sounds under the rubble, looking for survivors.Victims identifiedSocial media tributes helped to identify the names of 139 civilians belonging to 14 familiies – 133 of which were killed in the deadly strike.Joyfel (Joufil) familyAccording to the Facebook condolence message by Khaled Ali Joufil, Hisham Joyfel (Abu Youssef) lost his mother, Umm Issam Joyfel, and seven of his children, including his only son 4 year-old Youssef Hisham Joyfel and his six daughters – 22 year-old Walaa Hisham Joyfel, 20 year-old Wafaa Hisham Joyfel, 14 year-old Ilham Hisham Joyfel, 11 year-old Sama Hisham Joyfel, 8 year-old Farah Hisham Joyfel, and 2 year-old Salma Hisham Joyfel.

It was written that on October 13, 2023, Wafaa had turned 20. She had many dreams and aspirations. She was intensely focused on her drawings, assignments, and competed with everyone. “Martyrs of Gaza” added that “Wafaa’s strong personality supported everyone around her. Wafaa was like a small mother due to her intense love and care for her siblings.” Two images of the deceased Wafaa were shared – one where she was studying, another one where she was standing outside in a black coat and light-blue hijab, apparently holding engineering tools.Her father Hisham also wrote a touching tribute to Wafaa, saying that “May God accept you in the gardens of bliss, the best engineer, the soul of my heart is loyal”.Al-Sharif familyAccording to the Facebook tribute by Yusef Al Sharif, Al Sharif family lost ten family members. A grandmother Umm Assem al-Sharif was killed alongside her daughter Mona al-Sharif, her son Assem al-Sharif, her daughter-in-law also described as Assem’s wife, who remains unnamed, and another daughter-in-law, Aya Abdulbasit al-Sharif, the wife of her son Karam, who survived.

Talha Balousha wrote a heartfelt post: “The mind is unable to think and the tongue is tied to speak.. I did not find words to console a grieving father who lost his small and beautiful family and lost a loving wife.” She added that his wife and children’s bodies were extracted from under the rubble and asked God to inspire Karam with patience and steadfastness during this great affliction.A friend of Karam, Hani Abu Mustafa, also expressed his shock and grief in a Facebook post. He wrote: “After the internet outage returned to my residential area… Every day I am surprised by a new loss of friends and comrades… The shock now was the martyrdom of the friend Karam N. Alsharif’s wife, his five children, and some members of his wife’s family.” He shared an image of Karam’s deceased wife Aya surrounded by three girls and two infant boys.Saleha (Salha) familyWithin the Saleha (Salha) family, a mother Najah Hatem al-Sadoudi, married to Magdy (Majdy) Saleha, was killed alongside her five daughters: Shaima Magdy Saleha, Shorouk Magdy Saleha, Nour Magdy Saleha, Shahed Magdy Saleha and Lana Magdy Saleha. Magdy’s brother Hani Salha wrote in his condolence message that his brother lost his wife and five daughters and asked that “God give patience to your heart and compensate you, and God willing, you will meet them in a paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.”Magdy himself wrote a heartfelt post dedicated to his deceased wife and daughters, sharing the images of the daughters being of different ages, some of them wearing hijabs.Abu Jayab familyEngineer Ayed Abdullah Abo Jayab (Jiab) (Abu Khalil) was killed alongside his second wife (unnamed),and his sister (unnamed). Also killed were his children from his deceased wife Umm Khalil who had previously died of Covid-19: his sons, 19-year-old Khalil Ayed Abu Jiyab, Abdullah Ayed Abu Jiyab and two unnamed daughters.Hosam Abo Nasser wrote a touching tribute to the late Ayed, calling him “my travel companion, my friend, the highest status in my heart.” According to Hosam, he spoke to Ayed just 4 days before the deadly airstrike, and Ayed told him, “I am in my house, where will I go!” Hosam added: “Greet Umm Khalil, your wife, as she is waiting for you there… We belong to God and to Him we shall return.” A colleague, Mohammad Bazour, and a relative Sulaiman Abu Shwareb wrote their tributes to Ayed.Ayed’s former employer, the General Authority for Civil Affairs dedicated an obituary to him, represented by its President, His Excellency Minister Hussein Al-Sheikh, His Excellency, Undersecretary Ayman Qandil, and all the Authority’s employees. Images attached show Ayed in front of a mosque with a Palestinian flag in his hands.19-year old Khalil Abu Jayab was remembered as a talented back-end developer at AccessLine company and a computer engineering student at Al-Azhar University. His friend Mohammed Wisah described the late Khalil as cheerful, promising, ambitious, generous, helpful, dedicated to work and learning. He further wrote that Khalil “was one step ahead of most of the youth of his generation. He was a brilliant programmer, working as a back-end developer.” Khalil was someone, Mohammed remembered, who “you get to know and say, ‘This guy is a god.'” After Khalil’s mother had passed away, he created a website to pay tribute to her. Mohammed Wisah shared several images of Khalil – working on his laptop, smiling while being surrounded by friends.Khalil’s brother, high school student Abdullah Abu Jayab, was also killed in the strike. According to the tribute by Mohammad Wishah, Abdullah succeeded and excelled and got 99.6% in the General Secondary Education Certificate Examination (Tawhiji) a few months prior.

You were happy that you became first in secondary school and that you made me happy new robes and a new bag. You died of your wounds two weeks later from the Mohandiseen Tower massacre and you joined your father.”Aseel also added an image of the deceased Suhad – a teenage girl in a white blouse and red trousers.Aseel Abd Jawwad, apparently a son of the late Anwar, wrote a tribute to his father and shared his image: a man in a blue shirt.

Salim’s brother Sufian wrote in a Facebook testimony dedicated to his deceased brother, his wife and children.Eight members of the family survived the attack – Dr. Bassam Shaheen himself, his wife Wafa, Wafa’s mother Ghanima Shaheen, Bassam’s son Nour El-Din, Amira Adeeb Shaheen and her young daughter Sahar Omar Shaheen, Anwar’s young son Khaled Kahil, and Alaa’s young daughter, Dana.Younis familyAdham Younis announced on Facebook that his cousin, identified as Ahmed Yahya Younis, his wife and their two children were killed in the bombing of Engineers Building. No names were recorded for the wife and children. Adham attached a picture of a smiling young man in a red T-shirt.Al-Dabaki familyAirwars identified at least seven members of the Al-Dabaki family reportedly killed in the attack.Ibrahim Hafez Al-Dabaki (Abu Fares) was reportedly killed alongside his wife and their two young children according to “Al-bureij gathers us” account, who also posted pictures of the man and the two kids. On social media, Ibrahim’s third son, Fares abu eyub, also published a tribute to the four members of his family.A source contacted by Airwars, who asked not to be named, identified Al-Dabaki family members killed alongside Ibrahim Hafez Al-Dabaki, including Ibrahim’s two children Firas Ibrahim Hafez Al-Dabaki and Nadia Ibrahim Hafez Al-Dabaki. They also listed among the victims killed Haya Ibrahim Hasouan Al-Dabaki – Ibrahim’s wife, and the three siblings: Lili Saedi Majdi Al-Dabaki, Maria Saedi Majdi Al-Dabaki and Hala Saedi Majdi Al-Dabaki. The same source told Airwars that they believed others from the Al-Dabaki extended family were also killed in this attack, as an hour before the attack, they were told new family members displaced from the North just arrived to seek shelter in the area – though they were not able to identify the victims or to provide a number.Khamees hussein on Facebook claimed that alongside Ibrahim – nicknamed in the post Abu Alam and his wife, 20 other members of the Dabaki family were killed in the attack, though did not provide their names.T Asmaa F Ali’s aunt’s familyT Asmaa F Ali announced that her “aunt”, her aunt’s sons, daughters, and “all her family members” were all killed in the bombing. No names were recorded. Without further details, due to the use of plural (“sons” and “daughters”), Airwars counted a minimum of one woman, four children and two family members (adults, gender unknown) killed. As no more detail could be found, It is possible that these victims have been identified already in the assessment above – should more information comes to light regarding their identity, this assessment will be updated.Unidentified victimsSome of the victims killed and injured of this attack remain unidentified.@AJArabicnet published a video where a journalist is showing dozens of civilians using their hands to rescue victims killed or wounded buried under the rubble – at least four dead bodies are shown in the video. A video by @AJAPaestine featured two dead bodies on the ground covered with cloth.Adam Nawwas published a video on Twitter/X of an injured person being carried away. This person remains unidentified.Al Haya PS published a video of a very young child; the commentator explained that the child was killed despite the doctors efforts to save him. Twitter/X user @hassaneslayeh published a video of a man holding the same young boy in his arms, walking in a hospital; the source linked them to the Engineers Tower bombing. He was not identified. Twitter/X user Mahmudul Hasan @MahmudulHasa123 shared an image of a female journalist also holding the same boy in her hands, and the capture was “An unidentified child in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital from under the rubble of the Engineers Tower in the central Gaza Strip.”@Shimo_M_K and Salwa Rashid published the same graphic video of a man holding the body of an alleged decapited child. The sources commented: “Another massacre in Nuseirat… The Engineers Tower was bombed over the heads of its residents… A child without a head and with his entrails outside his body is the best witness to our shame.” On Facebook, Ahmad Abu Shamis released a picture of what appears to be the remains (bottom part) of an infant killed in the attack, lying on a bloody towel.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.Where possible, names and ages have been reconciled with published Palestinian Ministry of Health lists.

A further 280 civilians were reported injured by the director of the nearby Indonesian Hospital.A second strike hit the same location the following day, though the full casualty assessment for that incident will be reviewed separately by Airwars. Israel has confirmed that it conducted both strikes, with the stated target being Hamas leader Ibrahim Biari, and “his base”, according to IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari. Munitions experts speaking to The Guardian indicated that the IDF used so-called bunker buster munitions in the strike: 2,000lb bombs with an estimated crater size of 40ft which cause an “earthquake like” phenomenon on impact.The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights raised concerns on Twitter/X that the strikes may have been “disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes”. Though no official civilian casualty estimate has yet been conceded by Israeli forces, IDF Spokesperson Richard Hech acknowledged that the IDF knew that civilians were present, and said that civilian harm was a “tragedy of war”.Airwars has identified at least 116 names of civilians killed, including ten cases involving the fatality of more than one member of the same family. In three of these cases, families were reportedly killed in their entirety.The Al Qassam brigade official page posted that seven civilian hostages taken from Israel by Hamas militants, including three holders of foreign passports, were also killed. These civilians have been included in Airwars’ upper fatality estimate only, as they have not yet been otherwise corroborated.Numerous accounts on social media of relatives grieving over unnamed family members killed in the bombing have also been accounted for in Airwars’ civilian casualty range. When one source mentioned that a civilian and “his whole family” were reportedly killed, but the victims could not otherwise be identified, Airwars counted two civilians killed in its ranges as a minimum. In cases where sources indicated that “children” were killed without providing further information on the number of victims, Airwars counted two children killed as a minimum.Sources also reported that “a large number” of victims were still under the rubble after the strikes, with Hamas officials, quoted by the National, reporting that 120 individuals were still missing by November 2nd. These individuals have not yet been included in the Airwars casualty toll. No reports were found to indicate that there had been prior warning of the strike.“Apocalyptic scenes”Footage and videos released following the strikes showed vast craters, alongside dozens of onlookers standing on the edges and people searching for survivors. Local sources have widely referred to the bombing as a “massacre”. Pictures published by local and international sources showed entire housing blocks leveled.CNN said the survivors talked about “apocalyptic scenes in the aftermath of Tuesday’s strike”, with one eyewitness saying “it felt like the end of the world”. “Children were carrying other injured children and running, with grey dust filling the air. Bodies were hanging on the rubble, many of them unrecognizable. Some were bleeding and others were burnt,” Mohammad Al Aswad told CNN.The Washington Post reported that “Palestinians carried away the injured and dead on blankets and mattresses”. The Guardian described “body bags piled up with horrific speed at the morgue of the nearby Indonesian hospital in Beit Lahia, and then outside the building” and added that “the wounded filled [the Indonesian Hospital] beds or were raced to Dar al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, where medics from the Médicins Sans Frontiers aid group struggled to find space even for badly injured children”.“Young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. They came without their families,” said Mohammed Hawajreh, an MSF nurse who was quoted by the organisation in a statement condemning the attack. “Many were screaming and asking for their parents. I stayed with them until we could find a place, as the hospital was full with patients”.Similarly, @AJA_Egypt described scenes with “rows of corpses and shrouds…Jabalia martyrs piled up in the courtyard of the Indonesian Hospital”.One source on social media (@rdooan) said the bombing left “a hole filled with the corpses of Palestinian families”, while another source stated that “the bodies of families are crowded on top of each other”.Rescue efforts to identify civilians in the rubble continued after the strikes, with The Guardian reporting that following the strike, “rescuers combed with their hands through surface layers of a tangled mass of concrete and steel which hours earlier had been homes in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza. They were searching for survivors, or the bodies of victims, which the immense force of an Israeli airstrike had left near the surface. Those trapped deeper may be entombed for months”.Mahmoud Basal, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defense emergency services, told The Washington Post 20 buildings had been destroyed by the strikes, while Al-Arabiya wrote that the bombing “blew up an entire residential neighborhood”. One source specified that the location hit initially was the Al-Tarnis area of the camp. A number of sources qualified the bombing as a “massacre”. Journalist Anas Al Sharif described the destruction of dozens of homes in the “most populated area in the world”.AP spoke with Abu al-Qumssan, a witness of the strike, who described what happened:“In a matter of seconds, it turned into night,” Abu al-Qumssan said. “It felt like containers of explosives and iron were dropped on us. It was a very strange and bloodcurdling sound. I couldn’t make out the streets from homes,” he said. “People and bodies evaporated.” He went to his uncle’s house, only to find the flimsy metal structure had been crushed into nothing.Victims identifiedIn many cases, victims were identified on social media by survivors, relatives or friends.The Abu Al Qoumsan familyAt least 21 members of the family of Al-Jazeera broadcast engineer Muhammad Abu Al Qoumsan were killed in Jabalia. Relative of the Abu Al Qoumsan family, Mahmoud Abu Al Qoumsan, announced on Twitter/X the deaths of his relatives, namely: the three brothers Abu Al Thib Abu Al Qoumsan (Mahmoud Abo Al Qoumsan’s father), Abu Anas Abu Al Qoumsan, Abu Firas Abu Al Qoumsan. He also announced the deaths of Abu Firas Abu Al Qoumsan’s wife (name not provided), her two sons Wasel Abu Al Qoumsan and Mohannad Abu Al Qoumsan, and her two daughters Nabough Abu Al Qoumsan and Abrar Abu Al Qoumsan.He also recorded the deaths of Umayya Abu Al Qoumsan (Mahmoud Abu Al Qoumsan’s sister), and of his sister-in-law, described as the wife of his big brother Thib Abu Al Qoumsan. While her name was not provided, the names of her children were: two daughters Rahaf Abu Al Qoumsan and Layan Abu Al Qoumsan, and three sons Abdullah Abu Al Qoumsan, Mohammed Abu Al Qoumsan, and Aboud Abu Al Qoumsan.Imam Abu Al Qoumsan (Mahmoud Abo Al Qoumsan’s sister), and her three sons Yamen, Zain and Yazeed were also reportedly killed. Um Mohammed Abu Al Qoumsan, an Abu Al Qoumsan relative, said that her sister “Jamila Yusef Abu Al-Qumsan, mother of Rami Ahjazi” was also killed in the incident. It is unclear if she is one of the wives unnamed previously.Ra’ed Abu Al Qoumsan announced the deaths of his father, of his uncle Abu Firas, of his uncle’s wife and children – (the uncle, his wife and children have already been included above), of his sisters and their children, of his brother’s wife and her children. No names or ages were provided by this source, and it was unclear whether all of those victims have also been listed above.One additional woman from Al Qoumsan family unit, Marwa Basil Abu Al Qoumsan was identified killed by Al-Jazeera staff on social media. It was unclear whether Marwa was an additional victim, or whether her identity matched one of the women reportedly killed but whose name had not been provided.To avoid double counting the deaths of members of Abu Al Qoumsan family, where names were not provided by other sources, Airwars has considered these individuals were already named in the sources above in minimum estimates, though have been considered as additional family members in our maximum estimate.The Siraj familyA man identified as Abdul Salam Siraj was reportedly killed alongside all the members of his family. Ismail Mohammad Foda posted on Facebook: “My friend Abdul Salam Siraj, his entire family was exterminated in Jabalia… his mother, his wife, his two daughters, two sisters, three brothers, and his uncle’s entire family”. Airwars has been unable to separately identify the uncle’s family, and so has counted these as at least two individuals in our minimum range.The Khudair Ali familyMuhammad Ali announced on Twitter/X the deaths of nine of his relatives that he described as “my beloved ones, my heart and my soul, my support in my country, my cousins and my sisters, in the treacherous massacre in Jabalia camp”.He identified the victims as Fadi Khudair Ali and his wife (name not provided), Muhammad Khudair Ali, Malak Khudair Ali (described as his cousin), Khadra Jaber Ali (his aunt), and Khadra’s children: Ahmed, Zainab and Muhammad. He also named his cousin’s sons Haidar and Kanan Al-Daour. Another source said that “Umm Fadi” was grieving her sons and daughters, all killed in the Jabaliya bombing.The Masoud familyA friend of Omar Masoud “Al-Abeka” announced Omar’s death, alongside the deaths of his wife Donia Bashir and their four children (a son and three daughters). The source described Omar as a former prisoner who was detained for twenty years for killing an Israeli, before he got released, getting married and having children. The names of Omar’s family members were not provided by the source. Sources did not explain if Omar Masoud was imprisoned for being a member of a militant group, and also did not state if Masoud was a member of a militant group at the time of his death.The Abu Sultan familyNine members were reportedly killed from the Abu Sultan family, which one source said was killed in its entirety.Omar Mustafa Abu Sultan and his wife Sahar Abu Sultan (Al-Hoor), and their five children (four sons and one daughter) Mahmoud Omar Abu Sultan, Ahmed Omar Abu Sultan, Muhammad Omar Abu Sultan, Abdullah Omar Abu Sultan, and their daughter named Shahd Omar Abu Sultan. Ahmed Omar Abu Sultan’s wife, and his daughter were also reportedly killed (though names were not provided by the source). On the deaths of the Abu Sultan family, on Facebook, Suhil Yahya posted: “There are no relatives or loved ones left, they are all gone”.The Hamad FamilyMedhat Khalil and two other sources reported the death of Kamal Hamad “Abu Diaa” and his son (unnamed) in the Jabalia bombing.The Al-Tanani familyTwo children from the Al-Tanani family were reported killed by one source, namely Ahmed Salah Dhiyab Al-Tanani and Mahmoud Muhammad Dhiyab Al-Tanani. Their age was not provided by the source.The Okasha familyAt least 33 members of the Okasha family were reported killed in the strikes, according to AP. This includes husband and wife Rawand Okasha Umm Kinan and Belal Okasha, alongside their three children, as reported by their relatives Mohammad Okasha and Abood Okasha. The children’s uncle Ziad Okasha Abu Iyad and his wife Manal Okasha “Al-Najjar” were also reported killed alongside their son Youssef Ziad Okasha and sons of their late uncle Naeem Abu Raed.Another cousin, Raed Okasha, his children, and his wife, their cousin Muhammad Okasha and his three children Rakan, Amid, and Masa were also listed among the fatalities, alongside their cousin Yasser Okasha, his children and his wife, their cousin Nael Okasha, his children and his wife Islam Muhammad Al-Kafarna Okasha. A video posted on Facebook by Mohammed Okasha showed Yasser Okasha in combat gear wearing weapons, suggesting he may have been a militant. A post from Mona Sahle added additional names and offered her condolences to her cousin Nasser Okasha Abu Muhammad for the loss of Nasser’s daughter, her husband, and their children. Muhammad Okasha and his three children are survived by their wife and mother Samah Abu Saltah who was born in the Balata camp, and moved between Gaza and Nablus. Mohammed Okasha added the names Thaer Naeem Okasha and his family, and Muhammad Fayez Al-Zwaidi.The Alyan familyJehad Al Sharawi posted a memorial to her uncle Muhammad, uncle Hussein, and the Alyan family for the loss of: Youssef Muhammad Alyan, Mahmoud Jabr Alyan, Karim Majid Alyan. Ziad Alyan also posted a memorial for his brother Mahmoud Jabr Alyan.The Omrain familyFaraj Abo Mohammed announced five deaths from Abu Al-Omrain family : Ahmed Akram Abu Al-Omrain, Reem Muhammad Al-Firi (Abu Al-Amrain), Muhammad’s wife, and of three children: Rital Youssef Abu Al-Amrain, Abdul Karim Youssef Abu Al-Amrain and Zaher Ramadan Abu Al-Amrain.The Rayyan familyReuters published a video of a Jabaliya resident, identified as Abdel Kareem Rayyan, holding a paper listing the names of the 15 family members that he claimed were killed in the Israeli strikes. Abdel Kareem Rayyan declared to Reuters: “I lost my whole family, 15 of them. They were innocent, just staying in the camp. What wrong did they do? All of them were killed. My sister’s house with her children, my brother’s house with his children, all of my siblings, no one left except me and my younger brother. Fifteen people, these are their names – they are innocent an kind, it’s literally a massacre, complete destruction. All of the alley, 20 houses were demolished”.Airwars was able to identify the following names from the list he showed to Reuters: Raed Ahmad Rayyan, Hanna Rayyan, Sa’ed Rayyan, Maher Rayyan, Anwar Rayyan, Jannah Rayyan, Raed Sa’ed Rayyan, Hanaa Sa’ed Rayyan, Mahmoud Sa’ed Rayyan, Ghassan Mohammed Rayyan, Israa Mohammed Rayyan, Mujahid Mohammed Rayyan, Masa Mohammed Rayyan, Iman Saed Abou Hamdan, Karam Abdulkarim Rayyan.Another man identified as Hassan Ahmed Rayan told Reuters in the same video “The house had 15 people in it, until this moment we cannot reach any of them. Since yesterday, we’ve been trying to find anyone, but we couldn’t. There is no equipment, no civil defense teams, it’s all personal efforts to remove the rubble”.On social media, Ahmad Abi Ibrahim announced the deaths of his relatives his cousin and brother in law Raed Rayan Abu Saed, his “beloved sister Hanna”, described as Saed’s mother, Saed’s sister identifed as Anwar, and her sons. Janna is referred to as a younger sister with who they “recently celebrated her success in high school”.Maher is described as a ” decent young man, [who] spent his life in obedience to God, between the mosque and the university. He completed his education as a doctor and volunteered to treat the wounded in the Indonesian Hospital at the beginning of the outbreak of the current war on Gaza.” Nassma Jamal published on Facebook: “May God have mercy on the martyrs of the Rayyan family, relatives and cousins, who were martyred while they were steadfast and sitting in their homes in the Jabalia camp massacre. The martyr Abu Saed Raed Rayan, his wife, children and some of his grandchildren, his son Saed Rayan, his wife and children, and the wife of cousin Abu Ghassan Rayan and her children. Fifteen people, most of them children.” Airwars has estimated the minimum number of children killed in the Rayan family to be six, though the exact number is not yet clear.In addition to the victims identified alongside other family members outlined above, Airwars also identified an individual named Juma Muhammad Al-Shaarawi, whose death was announced by Baraa Samir describing Al-Shaarawi as a “good and decent young neighbor”.Unnamed victimsAs in many incidents of civilian harm, not all victims were named by sources.The Izz Al Din Al Qassam brigade official page posted that seven civilian hostages taken from Israel by Hamas militants, including three holders of foreign passports, were killed. The identity of the hostages was not provided.Airwars also archived a number of videos where relatives or friends spoke about their losses surrounded by scenes of desolation.In one video published by @Roaastudies and by Middle East Eye, an unnamed Palestinian man present at the scene of the incident was recorded explaining to the camera that he had three children and “not one has survived”. He is seen collapsing at the site of the bombing screaming: “My three children are all gone! My three children, Oh God! My three children! That other day, he told me to come, he told me “Come Dad””. A man holding him replies “Maybe we’ll find one, maybe we’ll find one alive”. The camera holder then says, “this is my friend, he just lost his family”.@ramiaalibrahim published a video including another Palestinian man whose name was not identified, was filmed walking around the rubble screaming “my son is a martyr, oh God!”, while an additional video published by @Yasser_Gaza on Twitter/X showed a grieving mother who reportedly “lost all of her children“.On social media, one video released by @Palestinealaa19 showed a father and his son at the scene of the bombing – the young adolescent was crying over bodies in plastic bags of members of his family lined up on the street. The father can be heard telling his son “you can’t collapse, you can’t cry, this is our destiny, we are not better than them, look they are all around us, we don’t forget them and the other 8,000 people – without counting those under the rubble, at least we got out, at least we knew who they are”.In one video published by @AJArabicnet, a child critically injured in the bombing asked his relative to give him water, while another video released by @Ahmed_GR00 shows a young girl injured with blood on her clothes. The source alleged that she lost the sight of her eyes but at the time of the recording was not aware of her fate.@shamel__news published a video of two young girls and one young boy rescued from the rubble from Jabalia. @visegrad24 mentioned on Twitter/X the case of a young boy rescued from the rubble by rescuers at the site but no further information was provided regarding the child’s identity. Documenting similar scenes, AP recorded “Young men [carrying] the limp forms of two children from the upper floors of the crumbling frame of one damaged apartment building, while helping down another child and woman. It was unclear whether the children were alive or dead. Gray dust, apparently left by pulverized concrete, seemed to coat nearly everything.”One Twitter/X the user @Mohammed78990 published a video of a baby followed by this comment: “painful scene from the Jabaliya massacre”. The same source explained that the mother was killed in the bombing. In another video released by @AJA_Palestine, a young man and his young sister were filmed sitting on the rubble crying over the death of their father. Overall casualty estimates provided by sourcesInitial reporting following the first Israeli bombing on October 31st recorded “a number of martyrs” and “dozens” injured, with Bellingcat setting the initial death toll at “at least 40 killed”, followed by the Guardian which initially reported that “47 bodies were “recovered from the rubble after an explosion in several houses in Jabalia camp”, analysing video footage published by Agence France-Presse.The director of the Indonesian hospital, Mohamed el-Ron, told the BBC that the hospital recorded 400 casualties, “including 120 dead”, the majority being “women and children”. In a press conference held at that hospital on October 31st, doctors announced that “at 4pm the Indonesian hospital received a high number of killed and injured after an attack on residential block in Jabaliya camp”. The medical staff stated that “one staff member lost four members of his family during the strike.” The same source added that the number of civilian casualties was bigger than their capacity. A number of sources reported “hundreds of injured and killed” following the two declared rounds of strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday. – with @ajmubasher reporting “more than 400 martyrs and wounded”, without further details.On October 31st, the Palestinian Ministry of Health initially counted “50 martyrs and around 150 wounded and dozens under the rubble in a heinous Israeli massacre that targeted a large area of homes in Jabalia camp”. Later in the day, the MoH said it feared at least 100 had been killed in the bombing, and hundreds others injured, according to @ariel_oseran.Airwars’ civilian fatality range reflects the number of individuals identified by local sources (both named and unnamed). As per our methodology, where specific numbers of civilians were not explicitly mentioned (such as reference to ‘multiple’ children), we have counted these as at least two casualties. Very few sources were able to report on exact numbers of those injured in the first strike, so Airwars has taken the number originally shared by the Indonesian Hospital of 280 injured civilians.Israel Defense Forces statements on civilian harmIDF spokesperson Lt Col Richard Hech acknowledged the Israeli strike had “destroyed a big chunk” of the Jabaliya camp. Hech declared that Israeli forces were aware that the area they targeted was an area where many civilians lived but refused to comment on any civilian casualties resulting from their actions. He justified the strike saying that their focus was on “a senior Hamas commander” who “sadly…was hiding again as they do behind the [sic] within civilians. And that’s all I can say at this point. (…)”.Similarly, The Guardian reported that according to the IDF “some cavities seen in images of destroyed camp buildings were created by the collapse of tunnels that had been dug by Hamas, which [IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari] said chooses to put key military infrastructure below areas where many civilians gather.”Military spokesman Jonathan Conricus quoted by AP News stated that the apartment buildings collapsed “only because the vast underground Hamas complex had been destroyed.” Similarly, AP News reported that “Brig. Gen. Daniel Hagari said an underground Hamas installation beneath a targeted building collapsed, toppling other nearby buildings. Conricus later said the main strike had hit between buildings. “We don’t intend for the ground to collapse,” he told reporters. “But the issue is that Hamas built their tunnels there and that they’re running their operations from there.”Though the IDF did not confirm the exact numbers of civilian casualties, interviews conducted with IDF spokespeople indicate that Israeli forces have acknowledged civilian harm as a result of their strikes on Jabaliya camp. Airwars has therefore graded the civilian harm status of this incident as “confirmed”, and archived relevant excerpts from interviews in the ‘strike report’ section at the end of this assessment.Combatant fatalitiesThe October 31st strike was reportedly intended to target Ibrahim Bari, described as a top commander of Hamas’s central Jabalia battalion, and a key commander during the deadly attack inside Israel on October 7th. Israeli forces believed that Biari had also been “leading fighting in northern Gaza from a network of tunnels under the camp,” according to The Guardian.According to The Guardian, Daniel Hagari announced Biari’s death alongside “scores” of Hamas militants – without providing the total number of combatants killed. He added that the strike on the building Biari was in “led to the collapse of other things because there was a very extensive infrastructure there.”@AvichayAdraee on Twitter/X released an IDF video in Arabic where Israeli forces claimed to have killed Hamas leader Ibrahim Al Bayari on October 31st in middle of Jabalia, alongside “many elite members” of Hamas. During a briefing (quoted by The Guardian), IDF spokesperson Hagari declared that “There are dozens of terrorists that have been killed with [Bayari], and the ‘metro’ underneath has collapsed, so it made this hole that you see in the area. We are dealing with terrorists that build the system of infrastructure of terror underneath the Jabalia refugee camp for a big reason. They want this picture of destruction.”Hamas militants “strongly denied the presence of one of its leaders in the refugee camp” according to CNN, with AP adding that “Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem denied the military’s claim, saying it was trying to justify “its heinous crime” against civilians.”With ambiguity around the exact number of militants killed, Airwars has applied a 12-24 combatant casualty range to account for comments such as ‘dozens’ of targets killed.Munitions usedWhile a video of the moment of the bombing was released by IDF forces on social media, the IDF spokesperson reportedly refused to comment on the number of munitions used or their types or identify “which craters were caused by tunnel collapses” – indicating that Israel would provide information at a later stage, according to The Guardian.The Guardian reported “at least five craters in the densely populated refugee camp, which weapons experts said were left by the use of multiple JDAMs – joint direct attack munitions – in the airstrike.” Former Pentagon munitions expert Marc Garlasco also told The Guardian that “the biggest crater at the site looked like a hit with a GBU-31.” “There are other bombs it could be. That one just fits best with all the evidence. The estimated crater is around 40 ft [12 metres]””.A former United Nations weapons inspector Chris Cobb-Smith, told The Guardian, “The munition is almost certainly JDAM, either a GBU 31 (Warhead Mark 84) general purpose bomb or possibly a GBU 56 (Warhead BLU 109) bunker buster. Both about 2,000lb [900kg].”According to The Guardian: “The GBU (guided bomb unit) is a precision-guided air-to-surface weapon system. It is part of the Israeli arsenal provided by the US and also manufactured by Israel under contract. These Boeing-manufactured GBUs use a tritotal, which is an explosive mix of TNT and aluminium powder, used commonly in air-dropped bombs. The Israeli air force recently posted images of dozens of GBU-31 being loaded on planes. “This fits our analysis. You can see the size of the bomb and guidance straps, which are the signature of the GBU-31,” added Garlasco.””Garlasco also told The Guardian that “the type of munitions he believes were used would have met stated Israeli military goals of hitting underground tunnels, but also caused extensive damage above ground. If they are set to have a delayed detonation, which is one of three options on the bomb, they cause an earthquake-like phenomenon when they do explode. “JDAMs will burrow through the ground, and have a delayed detonation, causing the building to collapse on itself. This explains the extent of the damage,” he said. “Buildings also collapse due to the blast wave, not just tunnels”.According to Bellingcat, on October 31, “Reports began to appear online about 2:30 pm local time (…) A Reuters live stream filming towards Jabalia and Gaza City appears to have captured a large explosion at approximately 2:24pm local time, consistent with the earliest reports of the strike on Jabalia.” This observation matched The Guardian’s findings, which noted that “The first online reports of Tuesday’s attack came at about 2.30pm local time. A Reuters live stream captured the moment of impact a few minutes earlier.” According to The Guardian, relying on Reuters video footage and other media content, the exact location of the strike was narrowed to buildings at the intersection of Al Mouhawel and Al Almey streets.Note that at the time of publication of this assessment, the Ministry of Health had not yet released an update to the list of named fatalities originally published on October 26th.Due to the scale and urgency of Airwars’ assessment process, all images have been automatically uploaded to each assessment with the graphic filter applied to protect users.

He wrote “We do not say goodbye, but rather we will meet in the highest paradise.” He posted many family photos, including those of his children Deneez and Ezzedine smiling and playing, as well as one of his mother Sameera smiling in a mosque. Mahmoud Geelan, a nephew of Sameera Afana, posted that his aunt was “a gentle caretaker and compassionate aunt,” and wished to all of his deceased relatives “May you always be in our hearts… may God gather us in the highest paradise.” He posted many photos as well, including photos of his uncle and cousins in academic robes and a family photograph of many members of the Afana family standing together in their formal suits and jackets smiling.Al Jazeera reported that dozens of civilians were wounded by the bombing. Safa reported the initial death toll was eight civilians, along with a number of injuries. A Facebook post by the nephew of Sameera Afana, Mahmoud Geelan, referred to Mohannad Afana, Moayad Afana, and Maamoun Afana as injured, and prayed that God would heal them. Later social media posts from the Afana family, including from Mohanad himself, indicate that Maamoun Afana died due to his injuries from the bombing but Mohanad and Moayad Afana survived.

According to the post shared by @mo2re5, the individual pictured was killed, and his name is unknown.While it is clear that the posts shared by @waseem_shbak, @mo2re5, and others on Twitter/X refer to the same victim as they shared the same image, Airwars is unable to determine whether the post shared by Flora al-Masri refers to a different victim, or the same individual. Due to this uncertainty, Airwars has recorded the number of civilians killed with an upper range of two and a lower estimate of one. Airwars will update this assessment should more information become available.Many media outlets, such as the Palestinian News Agency, Shehab, and Aljazeera have shared images of evacuation efforts and medical crew services transporting the injured, including two women and two children with visible injuries.In addition to tweeting photos of the bombing and evacuation efforts, @Rassd_Oman reported that most of the injured were children.Posting to Facebook, Aljazeera shared a video reportedly depicting the site of the bombing. In doing so, it identified the location of the strike as “adjacent to Al-Sharq Bakery” on al-Nasr Street. The video itself shows what appears to be a four to five story residential building situated in front of a large pile of rubble. The building looks to be almost entirely blown out, with no doors or windows remaining, and clear lines of vision between blown out windows on opposite sides of the building. In the video, shot both at eye-level and from a higher vantage, rescue crews hold hoses over the smoking rubble, appearing to try to put out any fire.According to Imane Ziane’s Twitter/X post, the bombing happened “in the morning.” The precise local time of the incident however is unknown.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the bombing to Israeli forces.The incident occured in the morning., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1 – 2Civilians reported injured4Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1 – 2Civilians reported injured4Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1 – 2Civilians reported injured4Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Based on the social media testimonies of the relatives and friends of the victims, Airwars identified 29 civilians by name that were reported killed in the deadly bombardment of the Bureji camp. Due to the lack of corroborating reporting for the higher casualty estimate, Airwars has put this casualty estimate to 29 civilians – though will update the range should further information come to light.Al Jazeera reported that residents of Bureij chanted “a massacre, a massacre” as they covered the bodies of those killed in Thursday’s strike with blankets. Alhaya news shared the images from the funeral prayer for the victims where bodies covered with white clothes can be seen.Dozens of civilians, including many small children, were reportedly injured.

Al Jazeera reported that “an Israeli air missile struck the al-Fakhoura school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing at least 15 people and injuring 54, according to the Palestinian health ministry. “The number [of deaths] is expected to rise,” said Muhammad Abu Silmeyeh, director of al-Shifa Hospital.” According to Daily Sabah, Palestinian Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra told Anadolu Agency that “an Israeli airstrike (struck) a school serving as a shelter for Palestinian refugees in Jabalia, resulting in 15 deaths and 70 injuries.”According to Al Jazeera, this was the third major attack on Jabalia camp (Gaza’s largest refugee camp) that week, and came hours after “a deadly strike on the Osama bin Zaid school sheltering (thousands of) displaced families in the al-Saftawi area north of Gaza City.” A witness who spoke to Al Jazeera claimed that four people in their family were killed or injured in the alleged bombing, and was quoted as saying “We have nothing to do with anything related to the Hamas movement. The room only had children and women.” In a Twitter/X post, Egyptian parliamentarian Mostafa Bakry alleged that Israeli forces “did not differentiate, killing mercilessly, the sick, schoolchildren, children, women and the elderly. Daily massacres, corpses dumped in the streets, body parts being collected in the coldest of times, hunger, darkness, and a shortage of medicine.”Drawing attention to the history of strikes on the al-Fakhoura School, Twitter/X user, @yasser_gaza, shared a photo from January 31, 2009, explaining, “In this photo, the martyr friend Ihab Ayoub appears sitting in the first seat, and next to him is a paper on which is written the name of our martyr friend “Ahed Qadas,” who was martyred with his colleagues in the #Al-Fakhoura_School massacre in 2009. Today, the [Israeli forces] committed a new massacre against the displaced people in our school, and Ihab was martyred yesterday.”Various sources shared photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack online. A series of images posted by Shehab Agency showed the aftermath of the reported strike, people grieving, and various injured being treated at the Indonesian Hospital, including a small child, with captions alleging that Israeli forces committed a “massacre at al-Fakhoura school.”In a video by Al Jazeera, a child tells the camera “I was standing here when three bombings happened. I carried a body with my own hands, and I carried another headless body with my own hands” as he breaks down sobbing. On Facebook, The Eye of Palestine shared a graphic photo of the bodies of six small children laid out on the floor, alleging that they were killed in the Israeli airstrike. Facebook user, Anas al-Sharif, posted photos of the “damages and injuries in the shelling of the occupation of al-Israa al-Fakhoura School in Jabalia, northern Gaza Strip, Gaza.” These images taken in the courtyard of the school show scattered food and personal belongings, as well as multiple casualties.On Twitter/X, @Roaastudies shared a video showing grieving individuals and numerous injured victims of the strike, including a child, who had been taken to a health facility. @EekadFacts shared a video of a journalist in a press vest showing bread stained with blood reportedly from the victims of the alleged bombing, while Orient News shared a video of a woman crying, clutching an infant, saying “Where is humanity and the Arab countries?” – it is unclear whether the child was killed or injured. Videos shared by Al Jazeera showed two injured children and an injured woman being rushed from an ambulance to the hospital, and a mourning mother bidding farewell to her killed son, saying “oh my beloved you are the fruit of my heart.”Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The incident occured in the morning., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, School, UN facilityCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed12 – 15(6 children)Civilians reported injured54–70Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducationImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

The source said “What happened could never be described, more like an earthquake, but more violent… Dust stormed the house, fragments everywhere. My mother and her grandchildren were in a state of panic and fear”.The family members were killed across three generations: grandfather Azmi Al Rayees and his wife Enaya Al Rayees were killed alongside their son, Dr Maisara Azmi Al Rayees, and their daughters, Uraib Al Rayees and Izza Al Rayees. Izza’s three children Karim Ramez Samir Nabhan, Adam Ramez Samir Nabhan, and Sham Ramez Samir Nabhan were killed as well.Several local sources reported that the bodies of the victims killed could not be rescued due to a lack of suitable equipment to search through the rubble of the family home. @HuDa_NaIm92 said that some neighbors were “digging with their hands under piles of stones and rubble”. Mai Mare on Facebook reported that “There is no hope of retrieving them. There is no equipment, no gasoline or diesel, no bulldozers, nothing.” Leqa’a Al Saadi said on Facebook that Muhammad Al Rayees and Moayad Al Rayees, two brothers from the Al Rayees family who reportedly survived the attack, “tried in every possible way to search for their family and extract them from under the rubble, hoping to find them or some of them alive”.The next day, on social media, Amr Tabaza called Palestinians in Gaza to help reach the members of Al Rayees family buried under the rubble, saying “The building is 7 floors… and no one has reached them so far.”. On November 7th, on Twitter, @Ali_Hisham added that Maisara Al Rayees had been buried under the rubble for two days and asked for help to “exhume his body to tell him goodbye one last time”. A second strike was reported in the same location just days after the incident, with additional casualties alleged. This incident will be assessed separately by Airwars.Dr Maisara Al Rayees was described as a maternal and child health specialist and a graduate of a prestigious UK Foreign Office Chevening Scholarship through which he studied at King’s College London for his master’s degree. Mai Mare said that Maisara worked with Doctors Without Borders. The same source indicated that she had met Maisara two months ago to send him “a special invitation to meet with British Foreign Secretary Cleverly to talk to him face to face about Gaza”. Mai added: “Just last month, I contacted Maisara and asked him if they would like me to work on a video for the Chevening Scholarships as a photo story, telling the story of [him and his wife’s] love, education and work in Gaza, but today, my heart is heavy and worn out with this news.” One source described Maisara as ambitious, kind and calm; someone who loved to help people. He had recently married his partner Laura Al Hayyek, whom he met on the scholarship programme. Laura Al Hayyek, an employee of the United Nations and a graduate of the Chevening Scholarship, was reported as killed in the bombing by some sources. However through private communication, Airwars researchers have been able to confirm that she was not present when the strike occurred.Uraib Al Rayees was described as creative. He was said to be a dentist and a painter.A BBC article published five days after the strike reported that “The Foreign Office on Wednesday said it was “devastated” and offered condolences to the surviving family and “Chevening Alumni community” over the death of Dr Al Rayees but didn’t give any details about what happened to him, or where.” The handling of this incident reportedly led to internal complaints within the Foreign Office that the government was showing a “permissive approach” to Israel “breaching international humanitarian law””.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.

The alleged strike killed 12 other members of the Al-Jaja family, including four children and five women, one of whom was pregnant, and injured at least one other member of the family.Muhammad Al Jaja was a media worker and the organisational development consultant at Press House-Palestine.Muhammad Al-Jaja’s mother, Noura Khamis Abu Hasira Al-Jaja, and father, Ghanem Tawfiq Al-Jaja were reportedly killed in the incident alongside Muhammed’s wife, Shima Abdel Halim Abu Aska, and daughters, Sham Muhammad Ghanem Tawfiq Al-Jaja and Noura Muhammad Ghanem Tawfiq Al-Jaja. His sisters, Zainab Ghanem Tawfiq Al-Jaja and Israa Ghanem Tawfiq Al-Jaja were killed, along with Israa Ghanem’s husband Nimr Haraz and their two children, Muhammad Nimr Haraz and Hana Nimr Haraz. Muhammed Al-Jaja’s brother Tawfiq Ghanem Tawfiq Al-Jaja was killed with his wife, Hala Al-Amsi who was pregnant at the time of her death.Numerous local and international outlets reported the incident, including the Shehab Agency, Al-Jazeera, and the Committee to Protect Journalists. According to Muhammad Al-Jaja’s sister, Shaymaa Ghanem Al-Jaja, her niece had survived the alleged strike but was injured.A graphic video showing at least five corpses lying on the ground and covered with blankets was widely circulated on social networks. Muhammad Al-Jaja’s blue vest and press ID were placed over one of the bodies. To the left appear to be the bodies of two infants sharing the same stretcher.Atef Abu Saif, who claimed to have been with Muhammad Al-Jaja the day before the alleged strike, wrote in a farewell Facebook post: “He was busy all the time providing assistance to the afflicted in shelter centres, calling and going to bakeries and supermarkets. From seven in the morning until sunset, he is busy with the worries of others. He refused to move south and remained steadfast in his home in the Al-Nasr neighbourhood until the shell came and killed him and his family”. He ended his message by writing: “In Al-Shifa Hospital, the press jacket over his body with his identification card reminds us of all the pain that awaits us on the road.”According to fellow journalist Belal Jadallah – who was later himself killed after an alleged Israeli airstrike on November 19th 2023 – Muhammad Al-Jaja was “a model of morals, professionalism, and chivalry”. Like Atef Abu Saif, he underlined his colleague’s commitment to his community: “Then, when he is almost done writing, he spends all the hours of the day during the war, running between bakeries, water stations, and stores to provide for the needs of those around him and his colleagues, and offering aid to the afflicted.”The post included two photos of a severely damaged building. A similar image was shared by the Facebook account MsdrNews: “The effects of the bombing that destroyed the house of fellow journalist Muhammad Al-Jaja, opposite Al-Shifa Tower, which led to the martyrdom of him and his family.”The day after he was killed, Muhammad Al-Jaja, along with Belal Jadallah, was scheduled to participate as a speaker in the conference ‘Freedom of Expression and Information: What Is the Role of New Media?’, organised by the Council of Europe within the World Forum for Democracy. In a biography published on the conference’s website, now dedicated to the memory of both journalists, it was stated that Muhammad had “12 years of extensive experience in organizational development and strategic planning, focusing on freedom of expression issues and journalist protection”. The biography also highlighted that he had “demonstrated a deep commitment to advocating for press freedom and the protection of journalists in Palestine and beyond.”Relatives and friends of the Al-Jaja family expressed their grief in posts on social media. According to some of these messages, Sham Muhammad Ghanem Tawfiq Al-Jaja, one of Muhammad Al-Jaja’s daughters, was only seven when she was killed. Several users shared a recent photo of Sham Al-Jaja from before the incident, wearing a red dress. The user @mrs_h45mes shared a photo of Muhammad Al-Jaja in what was “the happiest day of his life”. In the picture, he smiles at his new-born daughter, Sham.The X account @GazaMartyrs quotes Ahmed Al-Madhoon, who was reportedly a friend of the journalist: “When we used to meet, his daughter Sham would bring us juice, and we would accompany her to buy snacks for school. We would talk about her intelligence and how much she resembled him. He saw a part of himself in her.”A message of condolence shared by Shaymaa Ghanem Al-Jaja, Muhammad Al-Jaja’s sister, detailed each of the 13 relatives she lost on the 6th of November. “The eyes shed tears and the heart grieves, and we are saddened by your separation.”Muhammad Al-Jaja’s sister-in-law, Hala Al-Amsi, had married just that July and was four months pregnant, according to a message sent to the platform Untold Palestine by a friend of hers, Ruzalinda Al-Ashi. “I’m writing these words with tears in my eyes; they flow for my companion and the love of my heart, Hala.” In her message, she also mentioned that her friend was “happy to marry the love of her life” and that “joy radiated from her eyes”. “She is a very kind girl with a pure heart, a light on the soul, and a true friend.”Several international organisations – including the Committee to Protect Journalists and Women Journalists Without Chains – expressed their anger at the alleged attack and called for the protection of journalists and media workers in conflict zones. In a post on their official Facebook account, the WJWC declared that Muhammad Al-Jaja’s killing was a crime that was “added to a list of what we believe to be war crimes against journalists, which include murder, targeting families, destroying journalistic institutions, and restricting the work of journalistic crews.”Just two days before his death, Muhammad Al-Jaja posted his final Facebook message: “We are alone”.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed13(4 children5 women4 men1 journalist)Civilians reported injured1Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed13(4 children5 women4 men1 journalist)Civilians reported injured1Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed13(4 children5 women4 men1 journalist)Civilians reported injured1Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

This incident is recorded in casualty assessment ISPT0905.According to testimony posted on Facebook by Jaser Zourob, a friend of the late Dr. Maisara, ambulance personnel were unable to initially rescue family members due to the shortage of fuel and equipment. Therefore the two brothers tried to remove the bodies themselves in order to check whether “there was someone still breathing”. Jaser Zourob shared his loss of “Father Azmi Al Rayees, sons, Dr. Maisara, our friend, engineer Muayyad, his brother, sisters, and grandchildren.

Their daughters, Bisan Mari and Farah Mari, and their son, Elias Mari.Elias was identified by Abu Anes as a child, however, it was not clear if Bisan and Farah were also children. Therefore, the civilian casualty range for this incident reflected the possibility that Bisan and Farah may or may not have been children at the time of the incident.In the same post, Abu Anes described Muhammed Mari as “my brother and the light of my eyes”.Multiple sources, including Shehab Agency, reported that several people had been injured in the incident but did not specify an exact number. Therefore, in line with Airwars’ methodology, the range of civilians injured has been recorded as 2-2.A video published on YouTube by the news agency Al-Jazeera showed a crowd gathered amidst the rubble of a destroyed house. A witness reported that the house belonged to the Mari family and emphasised that they were civilians. A fire was burning on the ground floor of the destroyed house, and Civil Defense members were filmed trying to put it fireout. Another witness, his hands dusty from lifting rubble, described finding the bodies of three victims, two of which he said were “in bits”.The Al-Jazeera video was filmed after dark, therefore, it is likely that the incident occurred later in the day.Where sources identified a belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to the Israeli military.

Jewan was hit on her left thigh by shrapnel and Bilal was hit in the stomach or kidney area.In a series of three short videos posted on Facebook by her care-giver or guardian, named Naba’ al-Amal, Jewan could be seen sitting in a hospital bed, a blue blanket over her lap, telling the story of what happened to the camera in a quiet voice.In the first video, she said her father was called Bilal Al-Ashram and that he had been killed. She described the incident, saying that, when the bomb struck, she and her father were thrown to one side and her mother was thrown further away from them.According to the private source, Bilal and Jewan were taken to al-Ahli hospital by Jewan’s uncles. Jewan received minor treatment and had a plaster cast put over her thigh.There were no doctors available to treat Bilal at al-Ahli on the day of the incident. Jewan’s uncles then took him to the Indonesian Hospital where he was unable to receive treatment as the hospital had just run out of fuel. The uncles took Bilal – pushing him in a wheelchair – south on the Salah Al-Din road through the Israeli checkpoint, just south of the Kuwaiti roundabout. While queueing for the checkpoint, Bilal reportedly bled out and died, just 10 meters from the checkpoint.After receiving treatment in al-Ahli Hospital on November 15, 2023, Jewan was returned to her mother, who was sheltering in a cement factory in Gaza City, later the same day. She stayed with her for three days until her wound “began to fester”.In the second video, she said she was taken from Gaza (City) to the south of the Gaza Strip as there were “no hospitals in the north” and that she had spent two months being treated at the European Hospital.This is corroborated by the private source who reported that Jewan’s uncles and an aunt took her south on Salah al-Din Road on Saturday, November 18th 2023 to receive treatment for her leg.In the third video, she spoke about a man named Ibrahim Walie, saying that she loved him because he would “play with us and bring us things and he didn’t let us be afraid” and expressed that she wished he would come to visit her in hospital.Her aunt and uncle are a couple named Abu Salman Al Ashram and Umu Al Ashram, and her younger paternal uncle is called Hisham Al Ashram. She was seen in Al-Aqsa Hospital on November 18th, 2023.According to the private source, Jewan is a middle child with two older brothers and two younger sisters.Neither the videos of Jewan, nor the private sources explicitly name a belligerent therefore, in line with Airwars’ methodology, this incident has been marked as contested between the two groups active in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli Military and Hamas militants.The incident occured in the morning., SummaryStrike statusContested strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 man)Civilians reported injured1Causes of injury / deathDenial of access to/destruction of objects indispensable to survival, Heavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingContestedCompeting claims of responsibility e.g. multiple belligerents, or casualties also attributed to ground forces.Suspected belligerentsIsraeli Military, Palestinian Militants, Strike statusContested strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or Artillery, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 man)Civilians reported injured1Causes of injury / deathDenial of access to/destruction of objects indispensable to survival, Heavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingContestedCompeting claims of responsibility e.g. multiple belligerents, or casualties also attributed to ground forces.Suspected belligerentsIsraeli Military, Palestinian Militants, Strike statusContested strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or Artillery, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 man)Civilians reported injured1Causes of injury / deathDenial of access to/destruction of objects indispensable to survival, Heavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingContestedCompeting claims of responsibility e.g. multiple belligerents, or casualties also attributed to ground forces.Suspected belligerentsIsraeli Military, Palestinian Militants"

Al Jazeera Egypt reported there were “more than 150” deaths; Al Jazeera Arabic corroborated that the strike resulted “in the death of hundreds.” Dozens of deceased and wounded were taken to Kamal Adwan Hospital, according to @ajmubasher.The school, operated by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), was temporary home to many displaced families. WION News specified “airstrikes” occurred, but the specific number, if it was indeed more than one, is unknown. The consequence of the strike was severe; Philippe Lazzarini, the UNRWA chief, described the scene as “horrifying.” In a video shared by Al Ghad TV, a woman described how her “husband and children were turned into pieces.”Identities of many of the victims remains unknown. The director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, said that releasing the names of the dead was impossible because “bodies are everywhere.”Identification has been given, however, for some foreign nationals. Imad Sitou on Twitter/X claimed that two Moroccan women were killed in the strike. Eco Press corroborated this, though specified five people.

Initially, he was thought to be injured in the airstrike. Zakaria Mahmood posted on Facebook an appeal asking if anyone had seen him after he was transported to an unknown hospital after being injured in the strike. On the 25th of November, 6 days after the strike, his family finally received word that he had died from his injuries. Saleh Jadallah posted on social media that: “All the testimonies we obtained indicate that my beloved brother-in-law, the pharmacist Dr. Abdel Karim Muhammad Abed, was martyred and his body was buried inside the Indonesian Hospital. The people in the hospital were not able to recognize him, but our consolation is that he is known to the people of heaven.”Abdel Karim was the head of pharmaceutical control at the General Administration of Pharmacy.Sources differed about the nature of the strike. Many referred to it as an “airstrike” and one source, @Hind_Gaza, reported that Jadallah was killed by Israeli snipers. However, a number of large news organizations and close relatives of Bilal and Abdel Karim described the car being struck by artillery shelling from an IDF tank.This information was corroborated by a number of media outlets including Reuters, the Huffington Post, Middle East Eye, SafaPs, Saman News PS, Alghad TV, Pal Sawa News, and many more. The news was then confirmed by his family as stated in a tweet by @HosamSalemG. His death resonated amongst the journalistic community. It came after a series of journalists had already been killed in numerous air raids in the previous days and weeks.Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, released a statement on the incident, “I deplore the death of Bilal Jadallah. The protection of journalists as civilians is a requirement under international law, including UN Security Council Resolution 2222/2015 on the protection of journalists, media professionals and associated personnel in situations of conflict. I call for a full and transparent investigation to determine the circumstances of this tragedy.”@CanadaRepPA (Representative Office of Canada to the Palestinian Authority) tweeted condolences stating that Bilal was “a fierce advocate for #pressfreedom, mentoring generations of young reporters. Bilal, a gentle soul, was a friend and partner of Canada. He will be greatly missed.” Many pictures were shared of Bilal speaking at a press conference named the ‘Annual Award for Free Media” Ceremony.Another post, shared on Facebook by Abu Omar Qandeel reads: “Brother, respected colleague and great journalist Bilal Jadallah Abu Muhammad, director of the Press house, is a martyr”. Noma Hassan posted on Facebook: “Goodbye Bilal Jadallah. The Press House will not be our home without you.”Bilal’s brother, Salah Jadallah, also described the tank shelling in a Facebook post and expressed his deep sadness. Describing Bilal’s moves on the day of the strike, Salah reported that “Bilal was heading towards south of Gaza where Israel ordered civilians to flee. Bilal was very determined to stay in Gaza City for over a month and strongly believed it was his moral duty to tell the world what he witnesses in the besieged small city, assisting the needy people around him amid this humanitarian catastrophe.”Kamal Al-Diyan, a journalist for Al-Nashra, a news organization based in Morocco, paid tribute to Bilal. Jadallah had spent time in Morocco for work and had touched Al-Diyan with his love of Morocco and had left him with “good impression of the resilience and strength of the Palestinian people.”Salah Jadallah described Bilal as “the pillar of our family” and wrote that he stayed by his side “through thick and thin”. He described Bilal’s devotion to the Press House Foundation, “Nothing stopped Bilal’s to achieve his major project: establishing the EU-funded Press-house foundation to sponsor and support all independent freelance journalists who found a workspace at this place. He spared no efforts to protect them, arranging all of them safety courses, providing them with protective gear, and securing financial assistance for those facing difficult economic situations.”Remembering the past, Salah paid tribute to Bilal’s charitable works “My dear brother, I still remember when you were taking me along with you every Ramadan to hand out aid to all poor people in our old neighborhood. I would not forget how humble you were though you had a very high rank in the society and among all NGO figures in Gaza, welcoming everyone knocking at your door to seek help. I cannot forget when you took me with you few months ago to one of the autism foundations in Gaza, listening to their needs to secure enough funds for them through internationally recoginzed organizations. I am not able to attend your burial or kiss your forehead as we are not allowed to move northward”. He then shared a photograph of them standing together outside, dressed in a blue and a white shirt.A friend of Bilal called Rajab Al Sarraj paid tribute to the journalist in a post on Facebook, and described a conversation between them: “My friend, we argued, agreed, and we disagreed a lot on many things, but I still remember that we agreed years ago that there is a war that would be the last … and in every war we would ask each other is this the last war and every time we agreed that it is not the last and on October 7, we gathered at home in Gaza, and after what happened in the morning, we agreed that it would be the last, and I didn’t know that it was actually the last for you, my friend.”The Palestinian Ministry of Culture also shared a post: “The martyr Jadallah played a major role in embracing media professionals and training and graduating cadres capable of conveying the truth and continuing this journey within the difficult, complex and harsh circumstances that the sector always experiences. Through the Press House, Jadallah played a role in linking journalism with culture and heritage, and even activating its role in supporting the intellectual and the creative. He founded the Cultural Salon to discuss many cultural issues and shed light on various related initiatives and activities.”Many more photographs were shared of him with friends and family, smiling, chatting, and at work with kind condolence and goodbye messages mourning his death. Bilal Jadallah was known as the ‘Godfather’ of Palestinian journalism due to his activism and work with young journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists also shared a statement saying they are: “deeply saddened by the killing of Palestinian journalist and press freedom defender Bilal Jadallah, a previous contributor to CPJ’s work.”Salah Jadallah also shared a condolence message commemorating his brother-in-law: “Abdul Karim is one of the kindest, most wonderful, and most sophisticated people I know, not only as a son-in-law, but also as a brother and friend, and we do not praise anyone before God. He is kind-hearted, easy-going, friendly, and has a good attitude. He was well-mannered and did not know how to gossip. He spoke little, listened to others, and if he spoke, all his words were good. I did not know him hurting others. He chose to work in the medical field to be close to patients and strive with all his capabilities to help them and provide their medication needs.

In a post, the Hamad Residential City Facebook page shared the names as – the children Selina Muhammad al-Rayes and her sister Siwar Muhammad al-Rayes, Alia Ahmed al-Rayes, her sister Raghad Ahmed al-Rayes, and Ismail Youssef al-Rayes.Among those killed were the two young sisters, Selina Muhammad al-Rayes and Siwar Muhammad al-Rayes. In a series of heartbreaking Facebook posts, their father, Mohammed Rayyes, mourned that he had lost “the most beautiful, precious, and beloved blessings” in his life – his daughters, the “darlings of my heart”, and “the most beautiful thing my Lord has created” – and shared an image of him with his two daughters laughing. On December 31, 2023, Mohammed Rayyes dedicated two posts to each of his daughters. Sharing a picture of him carrying young Selina, he said, “Oh my soul, Selina, may God give me patience to leave you, father. The beloved of my soul and my life, I swear. The martyr, the soul of my heart, Selena.” In the other post, he shared a picture of him and Siwar, a small toddler with a radiant smile, and said, “The soul of the soul, the pulse, the passion, the love, and the beauty of the love Siwar. May God give me patience to leave you, my father’s heart, and soul. My martyr soul mate, my beloved love bracelet.” Mohammed Rayyes also shared videos of the children – one showed the two little girls laughing joyously with their father and playing with their toys, another showed little Siwar combing her fathers hair, and a final one showed the bodies of the two little children wrapped in white shrouds.Anhar al-Rayes named his cousins, Alia Ahmed al-Rayes and Raghad Ahmed al-Rayes, as further casualties in the incident, and called Siwar and Selina as “Zizi’s daughters.” In the post, he asked, “May God accept them as martyrs and strengthen our hearts”, and termed the alleged attack as an “assassination of childhood on childhood day” – November 20th, the day of the alleged bombing, is celebrated as World Children’s Day.Initial reportage from Shehab Agency stated that the bodies of three individuals killed and 12 injured had arrived at the Nasser Hospital following “an Israeli raid on Hamad Residential City in Khan Yunis”, with a later update to the death toll stating five were killed in the alleged bombing – this information was corroborated by Safa News, Quds Press and sources on social media. Quds further stated that children were among the casualties of the bombing, with Quds, Safa and other sources on social media sharing images of injured children being treated at Nasser Hospital, and other injured (including children and an elderly man) being carried into the hospital.Anadolu Agency stated that according to local sources reporting to Wafa news agency, “Israeli warplanes fired dozens of missiles at the Hamad residential city, northwest of Khan Yunis, killing dozens of citizens, most of them children and women, and injuring others.” Twitter/X user @SamiaBelounis1 alleged that most of the casualties were “innocent children”, citing a death toll of eight “so far.” Similar claims were made by @rida_ehab, who alleged that most of the casualties were “children and infants” and shared an image of injured children being carried into Nasser Hospital. An image shared by @Bernadotte22 showed two infants being treated by healthcare workers, while a graphic video shared by @AhmedAbofoul showed a heavily injured infant being carried on a stretcher, with the caption “Several killed and injured, including children” in the alleged attack. Another video, shared by @HollowDreams0, showed injured civilians, including children, being carried into Nasser Hospital, and a heavily injured child being treated by medical workers. Twitter/X user @MilitaryPOV stated that there was a total of 15 killed and 25 injured as a result of the alleged bombing, sharing a video of a crowd gathering near the site of the reported strike, with emergency workers carrying the injured out of the area – @MuhammadSmiry corroborated the casualty figures, alleging that “this is the second apart in the same area.”According to the Hamad Residential City Facebook Page, the fourth floor of Tower G3 was allegedly bombed – a video shared by the page showed the tower still standing but the floor destroyed. Images shared by Twitter/X user @PkSignofPeace showed the tower with the fourth floor and a part of the floor above it destroyed. Other videos shared by the Hamad Residential City page showed what was purportedly the aftermath of the strike, with dust covering the area in the darkness, emergency workers carrying the bodies of killed and/or heavily injured children, and ambulances rushing in amongst the screams and chaos, and a video of the injured being rushed into the hospital, including at least three children. Twitter/X user @msbnoun posted a video with the caption “This is the horrifying scenes coming out of Hamad City, west of Khan Yunis. No electricity, no disaster equipment to rescue the injured. This is absolutely heartbreaking to watch.”Where possible, names have been reconciled with published Palestinian Ministry of Health lists.

The school, run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Refugees (UNRWA), provided shelter for about two thousand displaced people fleeing from Central and Northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-affiliated Quds News Network report.Al Jazeera’s correspondent Hani Mahmoud reported that although there was a UNRWA flag on the roof of the affected school building, the Israeli armed forces still allegedly bombed it. The Twitter/X accounts Palestine Now (@PalestineNW) and @AlarabyT shared videos showing the aftermath of the attack where broken furniture in the school’s yard and traces of blood on the ground were to be seen.According to the video shared by the Twitter/X account of the Palestinian Refugee Portal, the attack happened at lunch time when people staying at the school’s premises were cooking. A young Palestinian girl in the video shared by the Twitter/X account @AlQastalps also said that “we were making food when a large bomb came upon us.” A young boy featured in the video by the Twitter/X account @M0SC0W0 said that during the bombardment he was staying at the school and was drinking water while @qudsn spoke with a man who “went to the market and came back and found his children had been bombed”.Referring to the Hamas statement where Hamas had called for an immediate action “to stop the targeting of civilians in schools protected under international law”, Anadolu Agency reported that more than 10 civilians were killed in the bombing. RT Arabic and Middle East Eye reported about 12 victims while Arabi 21 and Quds News Network estimated the total number of deaths as 15. Al Jazeera wrote that there were at least 20 killed civilians. Twitter/X user @PalinfoAr shared a heartbreaking video of a mother searching for her children among the dead bodies wrapped in white cloth.Airwars identified the names of two of the victims killed in the attack – Sami Mohammed Kalab and Bashir Othamn. Both names were identified from videos and images showing the body bags of the victims.As no clear information was yet available regarding the number of children killed, and as several sources reported that the majority of the victims were children, Airwars estimated between six and 10 children killed – half of the total numbers of victims reportedly killed.Dozens of civilians, most of them children, were also reportedly wounded in the attack on the UNRWA school. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported about 35 injured civilians. The Telegram channel of Quds News Network and a Twitter/X account @fouadkhreiss shared videos of the injured children being transported to a hospital. A Twitter/X account @EyeonPalestine shared an emotional video of a young Palestinian boy taking care of his sister injured in the school’s bombing. Al-Jazeera Gaza published a video showing the damage inside the school on Facebook where an eye-witness interviewed said that women were also among the victims – without providing a number. As such, Airwars estimated that 17 children were injured and at least two women were killed, and two other women injured in the attack. These estimations will be updated once more information comes to light.The sources differed in their reporting on the nature of the deadly strike. While OCHA, Arabi 21, Safa News and Quds News Network reported that the school was hit by artillery fire, Anadolu Agency referring to a Hamas statement as well as Middle East Eye wrote that it was an airstrike allegedly perpetrated by the Israeli military.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.

After a backlash, the paper removed the article from its website, saying on X (formerly Twitter) that the report “was based on faulty sourcing”.Open source investigations platform Eekad Facts also fact-checked the accusation from Israeli and Arab accounts that the dead infant in the videos was just a doll used by Hamas to promote their agenda. Eekad Facts found that the original clip of a man carrying the infant was published on the account of Palestinian journalist “Hani Abu Rizq” on December 1st. The source also quoted the National Library of Medicine website who advise that “after death the skin becomes pale and gray, and the tension inside the eye is lost, which leads to its relaxation if left open”. Logically Facts also carried out a fact checking investigation with similar conclusions.Journalist Mohannad Rasheed interviewed the mother of the child. Anadolu Agency also spoke with the grandfather of the infant, Attiya Abu Amra, and the mother, Asmahan Attia Al-Zahar. The Kashif Observatory also verified the validity of the videos of the infant as well as the report of the infants death by speaking with the child’s grandfather Attiya, who said that his daughter (the child’s mother) “was breastfeeding him and he was in good health and was not complaining of any harm, but they were subjected to shelling from artillery and tanks, forcing them to escape. They transferred the child to Al Awda Hospital, which asked them to transfer him to Al Aqsa Hospital so that his martyrdom would be announced.” Asmahan told Al Araby News that “Israeli artillery bombed the house next to their house, and that she ran outside carrying her infant, and she most likely thought he was still asleep, but he had been killed.”According to @ShehabAgency, the infant was killed in Nuseirat camp while others referred to the location as the “Al-Mughraqa area”.Where sources identified the belligerent responsible, all sources attributed the attack to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 child)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 child)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed1(1 child)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Montaser continued to bleed for about half an hour without any of the ambulances being able to reach him until he was transported in a civilian car to the Baptist Hospital. There, the doctors could not treat his injury because it was serious due to the lack of medical capabilities, which led to his death.”A colleague of Montaser posted a memorial for him, adding that he was “with us in covering the massacres in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the war” and ultimately was a victim of bombings twice. According to @muhammadshehad2, Montaser had continued to work despite the “untreated” injury he had from the initial bombing and @fatimah_j_ tweeted that Montaser had posted “if God has given you what you love, do what he loves” two days before his death. Montaser had also posted videos of himself feeding stray cats in Gaza. After his death, a cartoon of a smiling Montaser feeding cats in a bombed out Gaza was widely shared online.SKeyes Center for Media and Cultural Freedom also described Marwan as a “freelance photographer” and Alaa Kamal posted a condolence message for his “beloved and childhood friend” Marwan, along with an image of him with his press equipment. Shirin Observatory also posted a memorial for Marwan: “Marwan was born on January 12 (30 years old) in Gaza, Palestine, and he lived and grew up there. He was always proud of his father, loved his country and his friends, and was a sincere, creative, and smiling person. Studied technology at the University College of Applied Sciences – Gaza.

The exact number and names of victims is not known at this time; however, 50 homes were destroyed in the strike, resulting in hundreds of reported casualties.Airwars has been unable to identify the victims further, though due to local reporting has estimated a casualty range of at least 300 civilians, though some reports put the toll to more than 500. This is based on identified consensus among local reporting.In the aftermath of the attack that day, the Palestinian Civil Defense (PCD) shared a video of the destruction on Facebook, writing in the caption that “The Israeli [military] commits a new massacre in the [Shujaiya] neighborhood…Civil Defense crews in Gaza Governorate recovered a large number of martyrs and wounded from under the rubble of a residential square that was targeted by Israeli [military] aircraft in the [Shujaiya] neighborhood, east of Gaza City. Search operations are still continuing by Civil Defense crews at the place.” In the video, rescue crews and other residents comb through the expansive field of debris from crushed buildings, with many piles of rubble still smouldering.An article by Sky News Arabia reports that “Mahmoud Basal, spokesman for the Civil Defense in Gaza, told Sky News Arabia the details of what happened to the [Shujaiya] neighborhood in the morning, saying that the Israeli forces targeted an entire residential square in the [Shujaiya] neighborhood inside Gaza City that was inhabited by displaced people, with live bombardment. In his estimates, the number of victims reached 500, including at least 300 dead, in addition to the destruction of entire buildings.”On December 4th 2023, Le Monde reported that “The Israeli army razed an entire housing block to eliminate one Hamas commander on Saturday, December 2, in Shujaiya, a district of Gaza City, causing carnage among the population. According to the Palestinian enclave’s Civil Defense, the death toll from this operation is in the hundreds, making it possibly the deadliest bombardment in almost two months of war.” The article also reports that “Gaza’s Civil Defense, which was dispatched to the scene, initially cleared “around 60” bodies, according to spokesman Mahmoud Basel, before having to withdraw to protect themselves from further gunfire. The teams had great difficulty in navigating the “10 craters, each around 25 meters long and 15 meters deep” left behind by the explosions, he said. Based on the number of missing residents, Basel estimated that over 300 people were dead, most of them still trapped in the rubble. Shortly before dusk, his men heard voices. “We pulled out a woman who was nine months pregnant. The teams were still searching for survivors when they themselves were targeted by a strike. Four of us were injured and taken to hospital,” said Basel.”Le Monde also spoke with Abou Nafez, a former Palestinian Authority police officer, who was at his home with his wife and their children when a part of his house “fell on him”. He described the aftermath as “For an hour, you couldn’t see anything, everything was shrouded in dust and smoke was billowing from the ruins.” 45-year-old Abou Nafez sustained minor injuries from the attack, adding that “I haven’t seen anything like this since the war started. We don’t know whose bodies we’re finding, they’re all mixed up, the houses have collapsed one on top of the other.”Numerous social media users posted about the strike, with many sharing photos and videos as well. On December 2, Facebook user Adel Samarah shared two videos apparently showing airstrikes on the residential square, with smoke and dust billowing from numerous buildings after being hit. The accompanying caption says, “In [Shujaiya], a very serious massacre…The [Israeli forces] fired dozens of missiles and destroyed more than 50 homes above the heads of their residents. God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs. Urgent: More than 300 martyrs in the [Shujaiya] massacre up to this moment after the [Israeli] aircraft bombed more than 50 residential buildings above the heads of its residents a short while ago.”The same day, Facebook user Jenin Jenin wrote “A very large massacre in Shujaiya…An entire square in [Shujaiya] has 50 houses…More than 1,000 injured and martyred. All of the homes are displaced.” Mahmoud Younis shared two photos of the aftermath of the strikes, writing “50 houses were bombed at once in a residential square in the [Shujaiya] neighborhood in northern Gaza…The numbers of martyrs are not known yet. It exceeded 500 martyrs in the [Shujaiya] neighborhood only!!! There is still a lot under the rubble. You can imagine the numbers and imagine that they are human beings, right!!” On December 3, @karineomar143 posted a video of the destruction on Twitter/X, writing “A residential square containing at least 1,500 people, half of which are children, in the Shujaiya neighborhood in Gaza was completely flattened by the Israeli [military]. Barely any survivors.” On December 4, 2023, Mahmoud Alasouli shared a video on Facebook of the strike site with the caption “A view of the effects of heavy bombs and missiles and the massive destruction they caused in a residential square in the Shujaiya massacre yesterday in Gaza.” In the video he posted, people can be heard screaming as they navigate deep craters and mounds of shattered concrete. Facebook user Hatem Sakr shared a video of “The moment two children were rescued from under the rubble after an Israeli bombing targeted a residential square containing more than 50 inhabited homes in the Shujaiya neighborhood.”Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari announced that Wissam Farhat, battalion commander in charge of Shujaiya, was killed during this attack. According to the IDF, Farhat “planned and sent terrorists on October 7 to the Nahal Oz kibbutz and army post, in the cruel massacre that was carried out”.

The victims were identified as 27 year old writer and novelist Nour al-Din Hajjaj, and Hamza Haider Hajjaj.In a Facebook post, user Ahmed Ayyad stated that the alleged bombing on Nour’s house was carried out by Israeli warplanes in the morning, stating “a short while ago, the honourable young man, creative writer and novelist Nour al-Din Hajjaj was martyred.” In an announcement posted to their Facebook page, the Palestinian Ministry of Culture alleged that Nour “was born in Gaza on January 31, 1996” and “completed his university studies in Mathematics and Computers.” It said he was killed “in an Israeli raid, as a result of the continuous bombing of the Gaza Strip.” The Hajjaj Family Gathering page on Facebook posted the names of Nour, and Hamza Haider Hajjaj, saying that the “Hajjaj family is still bidding farewell to its children…the eyes shed tears and the heart grieves, and I am saddened by your separation.”In the post by the Palestinian Ministry of Culture, it was revealed that Nour, who worked as a teacher at the Carmel Secondary School for Boys in Gaza City, was an active part of many cultural initiatives including the Shagaf Cultural Initiative, the Cordoba Gathering, and the Theater Days Foundation. Furthermore, he had “published two novels, the first of which was entitled “Strange and Strange” in 2018 by Al-Kalima Publishing House in Cairo.” Al Araby News and The Literary Hub added that the second novel Nour wrote was titled “Wings That Do Not Fly”, published in 2021 by Fadaat Publishing House in Jordan, and that Nour was the author of the play The Gray Ones (2022). An image of Nour shared by Facebook user Amal Hada showed him smiling, holding a Palestinian Oud (stringed instrument), with the caption “Martyr poet and writer Nour El-Din Hajjaj.”Friends and family wrote heartfelt messages on social media mourning the death of Nour al-Din Hajjaj. Yahya M al Qassas shared an image of Nour and himself at their graduation ceremony, smiling with joy and posing with a thumbs-up, attired in their ceremonial robes and hats. Yahya described Nour as his “beloved friend..a long-distance companion and classmate”, and as “the writer and intellectual.” Ahmed Ayyad wrote that he met Nour for the first time in Cairo a year ago, and in the time they spent together Nour spoke “about life in Gaza, about his literary journey, and about his dreams for the world of writing and creativity.” Sharing an image of the two of them standing together, Nour – a smiling young man in a yellow jacket, Ahmed bid him farewell, saying “a young man who had a beautiful dream of becoming a famous writer. May God have mercy on you, my dear beloved.”Twitter user @alijla2021 shared a photo of Nour, a young man with a gentle smile, wearing a black shirt. The comment read ‘A shocking murder of a young, brilliant Palestinian mind. He had an amazing future ahead as a novelist and writer. He was murdered in his home in Shejaia yesterday, along with dozens of his relatives. One of his last words…“You run away from a rocket behind you, only to be caught by another in front of you. In Gaza, there are no longer four directions, because all of them now overlook the same scene, which is ‘destruction”’ Other friends and relatives described Nour as “dear brother and friend…the educated poet”, “the good, kind, easy-going, gentle, contented, chaste, and calm friend”, “I heard nothing but politeness and respect from him”, and “friend and colleague.” Oday Alaa posted “today’s shocking news / Dear heart, Nour al-Din Hajjaj Shahid / God bless his soul….Yes, he was a brother, friend, and classmate / Goodbye, Habib / Two days ago, you talked to me.”Mohemed jemil al hazazeen announced the death of Hamza Haider Jajjaj and Nour al-Din Hajjaj on Facebook, sharing two photos alongside a comment that read ‘To the mercy and satisfaction of God, loved ones and life-long neighbors’. In a photo Hamza is depicted as a teenager wearing a turquoise hoodie smiling toward the camera – Mohamed describes him as “the beloved, gallant neighbour Hamza.” Nour is shown sitting at a table in a gray blazer and a silk neck scarf, with the Keffiyeh pattern, speaking into a microphone.The Literary Hub commemorated Nour al-Din Hajjaj in a post, sharing his final message which was further shared by many on social media. It read “This is why I am writing now; it might be my last message that makes it out to the free world, flying with the doves of peace to tell them that we love life, or at least what life we have managed to live; in Gaza all paths before us are blocked, and instead we’re just one tweet or breaking news story away from death. / Anyway, I’ll begin. / My name is Nour al-Din Hajjaj, I am a Palestinian writer, I am twenty-seven years old and I have many dreams. / I am not a number and I do not consent to my death being passing news.

Airwars’ researchers identified 20 civilians killed in this incident. Among the deceased were Amjad Kamal Noman Salman Mushtaha (Abu Haitham); his two sons, Haitham Amjad Mushtaha and Kamal Amjad Mushtaha; his brother, Nashat Kamal Noman Salman Mushtaha (Abu Tariq); and his nephews Jaafar Magdy Kamal Noman Salman Mushtaha and Hamza Magdy Kamal Noman Salman Mushtaha.Ayman Harbi Rushdi Saeed Amin Mushtaha; his mother, Umm Ayman; his wife, Alaa Nafez Hussein Amin Mushtaha (Al-Mukhtar Saber); and their children were killed in the incident along with Maha Khalaf (Umm Anas, wife of the martyr Muhammad Harbi Rushdi Saeed Amin Mushtaha) and Maha’s children. Mona Harbi Rushidi Saeed Amin Mushtaha (Umm Youssef, daughter of the martyr Mahmoud Harbi Rushdi Saeed Amin Mushtaha); and Mona’s son Youssef were also named as having been killed. A family relative named Fadi Mushtaha also named their cousin Hasib Muhammad Al-Hato Abu Yazan, their cousin’s son Moatasem Mamdouh Jamal Noman Salman Mushtaha, their “beloved” Mahmoud Al-Morashah, and their neighbour Moataz Aliwa Abu Omar as among those killed. Sharing his heartache, Fadi asked that God may accept them all.In @Abu mohannad moshtaha’s post, which identified several of the victims, he stated how “God knows that I am in pain over the separation from you, my brothers, my lifelong friends, and the loved ones of my heart, my nephews, but we cannot be patient that you are martyrs in the heavens of bliss. I do not say goodbye, but we will meet you in heaven, God willing. Oh God, they are your guests, so honour them with gardens as wide as the heavens and the earth.”Weeks after the incident @Gaza Martyrs wrote about Moatasem Mamdouh Jamal Noman Salman Mushtaha, a 25-year-old “creative individual in the field of design with several accomplishments. He was known for his ever-present smile, his kindness, and his interactions with people. [Moatasem] was martyred 10 days after the martyrdom of his close friend, martyr Hussam Abu Samra.” The post lamented how “another smile” has been lost in Gaza.The majority of sources only reported on “a large number” of people killed without details while the Palestinian Civil Defense “transported a number of casualties” after the strike on the Mushtaha home. An image posted by @boodi4 shows a infant who was reportedly killed in the strike.The Palestinian Civil Defense posted images of civil defence crews searching through the rubble of the home and trying to put out the fire caused by the strike.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The incident occured in the afternoon., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed20(5–9 children4 women4–8 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed20(5–9 children4 women4–8 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed20(5–9 children4 women4–8 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

Few specific details about the victims were publicly available.At 3:27 am, the Palestinian Press Agency (Safa), among other sources on local and social media, reported that Israeli forces had allegedly committed “a new massacre…by bombing the gate of Al-Fakhoura School in Jabalia Camp, north of the Gaza Strip”. A correspondent for Al-Ghad TV also reported on the alleged bombing by Israeli forces, stating that the strike resulted “in martyrs and injuries.” Yaffa News Agency reported that there were a “number of casualties and injuries” as a result of the alleged bombing. Marsal Qatar alleged that “Israeli warplanes carried out a new massacre earlier today”, and that “they bombed a residential square and the gate of Al-Fakhoura School in the camp, which shelters hundreds of displaced people.”On Twitter/X and Facebook, users @Poztve, Yousef el Hawney, and The Palestinian Community in Norway page shared two videos taken in the aftermath of the strike. In one 45-second clip, at least four casualties, including a child and a woman, can be seen lying on the ground, all of whom appear to be gravely wounded or dead. Screams are heard throughout the video, as people desperately try to tend to the victims and drag the bodies to safety. In the other video taken in the same area, locals can be seen trying to help a severely wounded and profusely bleeding man lying on the ground. The sources termed it as “a new Israeli massacre at al-Fakhoura school”, and as “one massacre after another.”The names, details, and precise number of casualties are currently unknown.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The incident occured in the morning., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, SchoolCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed2 – 4(0–1 children0–1 women)Civilians reported injured2–4Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducationImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

According to publicly available accounts, this resulted in the deaths of at least 30 and up to more than 50 family members, and caused dozens to be wounded, including children. Among the injured civilians was an infant girl named Layan Abu Musabbeh whose entire family was reportedly killed in the strike.Numerous photographs of bodies allegedly being recovered from the site of this bombing were published by MSDR News. Similarly, the radio station Mazaya Fm shared images showing members of the public and Red Crescent recovering bodies from the location. Anadolu News Agency cited the mayor of Deir Al Balah, Diab Al Jarro, who reportedly stated that around 50 civilians were killed in the house of Abu Musabbeh family, and the majority of those killed were displaced people seeking refuge in Deir Al Balah from other areas within the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City. The agency also reported that 50 fatalities resulting from the airstrike were buried in a mass grave because, according to Diab Al Jarro, the existing cemeteries were no longer adequate to accommodate the substantial number of the deceased. The lowest death count was provided by @adham922 which identified 30 people killed, “all of them children, women and innocent civilians” while the highest death count of “over 50” victims was documented by @QudsNen.According to Aljazeera, the dead and wounded were taken to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al Balah. The official Twitter/X account of the Palestinian mission to the UK shared the heart-wrenching images of the funeral of at least 45 members of Abu Musabbeh family where a crying woman was embracing a dead body of her relative wrapped in white cloth.In its Twitter/X account, Al Mayadeen News alluded to why the alleged bombing of this site caused such a high number of purported casualties, stating “A new massacre in #Deir_Al-Balah after the occupation targeted the home of the Abu Musabah family, which contained a clay bakery, around which people gathered to get a piece of bread.”In its coverage of this event, Al Jazeera posted a graphic video on Twitter/X purportedly filmed at the scene by a Palestinian journalist. The video shows the rubble left from the building, flames of fire and people carrying numerous bodies of the dead and injured civilians. An injured man and an injured crying boy are also visible. According to Al Jazeera Mubasher, limited supplies of medical resources complicated efforts to tend to the wounded. On this, the outlet stated, “It was documented that the wounded continued to arrive at the hospital, with a shortage in all hospitals in the Gaza Strip and a shortage of medical supplies.”At present, Mohammad Kamal Abu Musabbeh has been named as among the deceased. Condolence posts on social media were numerous. A friend of Mohammad Musabbeh, Muhammad al-Safir, described his last moments before the strike. The two had hugged only seven minutes before the explosion, and al-Safir remembered Musabbeh saying he was tired but that still he “smiled at me and said, I swear I love you.” Had he known this would have been the last time the two saw each other, al-Safir said, he would have “prolonged the hug.” From the attached image the late Mohammad appears as a smiling young bearded man.A little girl, Talia Khattab, was also killed in the strike. A committed student, Talia was remembered for her diligence to her schooling. Eager for the war to end, Talia reportedly told her grandfather: “Tomorrow everything will be over grandpa, I will go to kindergarten and get the highest grades.”Whilst describing how this incident orphaned an infant girl Layan Abu Musabbeh to the news outlet Al Watan, a relative Muhammad Abu Musabbeh said that the explosion threw her and her bed into one of the neighbors’ houses. He also described the aftermath of the bombing stating that, “The scene we saw cannot be described. We heard a loud explosion, so we quickly left the house. I was surprised that it was the house of my cousin and his family. The scene was horrific, fires burning in the house.” Abu Musabbeh also said that they were searching for the child for several hours, and “almost lost hope, until one of the neighbors heard the sound of a child crying, and upon tracing the source of the sound, we found that she had flown away.”A Twitter/X user @monther_khaled posted a video showing the infant Layan wrapped in green cloth.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.

Airwars was able to identify 104 named victims (102 fatalities, and two others injured), though some local reports put the death toll at 200 civilians.Airwars estimates that 50 children* were killed in the attack, which some sources said wiped out almost an entire neighbourhood. It was reported that many of the victims sought refuge in this house to escape the incursion of the Israeli forces into areas of Gaza.Shehab Agency, Warfare Analysis and other sources initially reported “dozens of martyrs and wounded”. Other sources, including IMEMC news and Mondoweiss news, wrote about 15 civilians killed and dozens injured. According to a news report by arabi21.com, approximately 50 people, including men, women and children, were home in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood at the moment of the strike. A Twitter/X user Younis Tirawi (@ytirawi) wrote that the rescue teams managed to retrieve 32 dead bodies and estimated that an additional 80 were still beneath the rubble.Other social media users and Salem family members provided much higher casualties figures. According to the Facebook user Yahya salem, one of the affected houses belonging to his uncle Suleiman was bombed after his uncles and their children gathered there, leading to the death of around 50 people. Another user @humanprovince wrote that his good friend’s entire extended family was wiped out yesterday in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood of Gaza City as 70 members of the family were killed. A Twitter/X user @MariamBarghouti wrote that 100 members of the Salem family were killed in the 24 hours since the strike, adding that “There is massacre on top of massacre on top of massacre in Gaza.”A Facebook user Yahya Salim wrote that 100 family members were killed, and dozens were still under the rubble. He also shared a video showing a completely destroyed building and ongoing rescue efforts – people searching for the bodies of their beloved under the rubble, mentioning that these are his uncles, cousins, his mother and father who remained alive. He added: “there is no ability to rescue those trapped under the rubble, no cars transporting the martyrs and the injured.”A family relative Ramy salem wrote: “107 martyrs so far and still missing under the rubble💔” Another family relative, Ahmad Salem, alleged that the death toll was higher – according to him, about 130 members of his family were killed, including his uncles and aunts, and their children. A Facebook user Ana Safaa estimated that the number of the victims killed was even higher, up to 200, writing that “a large number of the family were martyred, approximately 200 martyrs, and a large number are also seriously injured.”Tributes by family relatives and friends helped Airwars to identify victim names as well as family connections. In particular, the condolence message by Mohammed Salem helped to narrow down the fatalities list to the specific families/houses within the extended Salem family. In cases where sources did not explicitly specify the family connections between the victims, identification through their three full names (usually referring to the victim’s first name, followed by the first name of their father, and their family name) was used.The extended Salam familyAbu Akram familyAn elderly woman Umm Akram Salem, wife of Abu Akram, was killed alongside her two sons, Akram Khalil Salem (Abu Youssef) and Abdul Rahman Salem (Abu Uday), her daughter-in-law, Akram’s wife, Zainab Saber Salem (Umm Youssef), Akram and Zainab’s son Younis Akram Salem and an additional unnamed child, and Abu Uday’s daughter Nada Abdul Rahman Salem. Umm Akram’s daughter Hana Henno Khalil Salem and her husband Sherif Saber Salem were also killed. Fadl salem abu anas shared an image of two men, Sharif Salem and Rami Salem (mentioned below in “Abu Ramzi house” section), indicating that both of them are “in heaven”.The surviving sister of Akram and Hanna, Ana Safaa, expressed her grief in a testimony online: “And it goes a💔 black year, yes, a black year that was full of calamities. . .I lost the most precious thing… my mother, my heaven Umm Akram Salem.” In another post, Ana Safaa explained that her mother, Umm Akram Salem, underwent a heart surgery (“she came out of the death before the war with heart operations”), and that her brother’s wife, Umm Youssef, was like a second mother to her.A daughter of Ana Safaa’s brother Abdullah Khalil Salem, identified as Sirin Salem, was also reportedly killed.Ana also mourned the death of her sister Hanaa and Hanaa’s husband Sheriff, her brother Abu Youssef and his wife Umm Youssef along with her nephew Younis Salem, her brother Abu Uday and his daughter Nada Salem. She wrote about Younis that “he had never harmed anyone in his life”Fadl Salem Abu Anas wrote a tribute to the memory of Abu Youssef, his wife Zainab and their children, sharing an image where one of the men making a meal outside was apparently Abu Youssef. Only one child of Akram Khalil Salem (Abu Youssef) could be identified (Younis Akram Salem).Mohammed Salem mourned the death of his beloved aunt, Umm Akram, “the beloved martyr Abu Youssef”, the martyrs Umm Youssef Zainab Salem, Younis Akram Salem and Umm Ali Howaida Nafez Salem.The Abu Ramzi houseAccording to Mohammed Salem, other family members were killed in the Abu Ramzi house.

The children were identified by Yahya salim as three sons Mustafa Ramzi Salem, Mohamed Ramzi Salem, Muhannad Ramzi Salem and two daughters Nourhan (Nour) Ramzi Salem and Nawal Ramzi Salem.Members of Al-Shawa family, related to the Salem family through Suhair Majid Awni Al Shawa’s mariage to Ramzi Suleiman Salem Deeb, were also killed in the same attack (see below: Al-Shawa family).Al-Shawa familyAccording to the Facebook tribute by Moataz Shawa, the bombing of her sister’s Suhair house allegedly perpetrated by the Israeli military led to the death of 18 of her family members. “They were my whole life”, she added.She also shared pictures showing the complete destruction of their family home. “This is what’s left of my house, after all my family members were killed” Moataz wrote.Moataz’s father Majid Awni Jamil Al-Shawa (abu Fadi) was killed along with his wife, Moataz’s mother Helen Badie Jamil al-Shawa, their sons, Moataz’s brothers Fadi Majid Awni Al-Shawa and Ihab Majed Awni Al-Shawa, their daughter, Moataz’s sister Suhair Majid Awni Al Shawa along with her husband Ramzi Suleiman Salem Deeb (abu Mustafa) and their five children (documented above – “Abu Ramzi house”), their daughter-in-law, wife of Fadi, Nevin Suhail Abdullah Al-Shawa (Al Sarsak), their daughter-in-law, wife of Ihab, Walaa Hossam Salim Al-Shawa (Al-Sarsak) and their grandchildren.Among the grandchildren killed in the attack were sons of Fadi and Nevin Fares Al-Shawa and Firas Al-Shawa, their daughter Shahad Al-Shawa; a son of Ihab and Walaa, Muhammad Al-Shawa, and the two daughters of Ihab and Walaa – Helen Al-Shawa and an infant Sham Al-Shawa.In one Facebook post, Moataz Shawa shared a group picture featuring her mother Helen, her sister Suhair, her niece Nawal, her brother Ihab, Ilhab’s wife Walaa with the 5-month old daughter Sham. She wrote the heartbreaking words that all of them were killed: “Everyone in the picture was killed by Israel. They were all martyrs in a hideous massacre carried out by [Israeli] aircraft that killed 18 people from my family. Every person has a story, a story, and a dream that he was seeking to implement.”In a separate post, Moataz shared the pictures of her sister Suhair – a smiling young woman in a black dress and a grey hijab, and of her children who were killed. In one more post, she shared the pictures of her deceased father Majed and her mother Helen – he is dressed in a suit with a black tie, and she is in a black embroidered dress and hijab. In other posts, she shared the pictures of her brothers Fadi and Ihab and their children.Another family relative, Ghadeer Mohammad, also mourned his aunt Helen Al-Shawa, his uncle Abu Fadi Em Fadi Al-Shawa, his relative Nevin, “the kind and compassionate one”, and Suhair. He also wrote a condolence message to the apparently surviving member of the family, Eman Majed Al-Shawa, saying: “Dear Eman, may God give you patience, strengthen you, and give your heart patience.“The Shawa Family Facebook account also wrote a tribute to the 19 members of the Al-Shawa family who were killed “while they were safe in their home in Gaza City – Sheikh Radwan neighborhood”, and went on to “ask God Almighty to grant them wide mercy, forgiveness, and the highest paradise in Paradise, and to accept them as companions with the prophets, the truthful ones, the martyrs, and the good ones.”Facebook users Al-qishawi Nael and Alaa al-Fasees mourned the death of Fadi Majid Awni Al-Shawa, calling him “our brother, friend, and comrade” and sharing a picture of a young bearded man in glasses.Abu Ghassan’s houseAccording to the post by Abdelmajeed Aljelekh, among the victims were also Umm Ghassan Salem and her four sons, brothers Yahya Zakaria Salem, Bassam Zakarya Salem (Abu Hamza), Hossam Zakarya Salem, and Ahmad Zakarya Salem, as well as her daughter with all her children, and the wife of one of the brothers, Yahya, named Sabreen Sami Kasbeh. Yahya Salim and Emad j Abushawiesh further identified Nidal Zakarya Salem, son of Zakarya Salem, as killed.Mohammad Sandouqa wrote that Umm Ghassan was a wife of the late Zakaria Salem. He mourned the death of the brothers – Bassam, Hossam, Yahya and Ahmad.According to the Facebook tribute by Omar Mustafa, Yahya Salem was his neighbour and childhood friend. He added that he was killed along with his mother, his brothers Bassam and Hossam, some of their children and wives..Qusi Mustfa Alooz also mourned the death of Umm Ghassan and her sons, sharing the image of Yahya and Ahmad, apparently quite young men.Mohammed Salem wrote that he lost his beloved aunt, Umm Ghassan, his nephews Yahya and Ahmed as well as Yahya’s wife.Mohammed Kusba, uncle of the late Sabreen, mourned her death and death of her husband and aunt: “With hearts full of faith in God Almighty and satisfied with God’s will and destiny, my niece (Sabreen Sami Kasba, her husband Yahya Salem, and her aunt, a thousand mercy on them) was martyred.”Ziad Salem (Abu Wissam)’s houseA family relative Waleed Naeem Salem wrote on Facebook that it was “a black day for our family”. He mourned the death of 60 members of his family, including his aunt, Bushra Ahmed Salem (Umm Wissam) who was killed along with her husband Ziad Abdel Rahman Salem (abu Wissam), their daughter Ahlam Ziyad Salem and their three sons – Wissam Ziad Salem, Abdullah Ziyad Salem, and Basil Ziad Salem. A wife of Basil, Shaima Akram Salem was also killed along with their sons Youssef Basil Salem and Zain Basil Salem. They were all killed in the house of Ziad Salem, according to Mohammed Salem, survived only by Hossam Basil Salem, one of Basil’s sons. Waleed also shared a striking image where names of the victims written in Arabic can be seen on the black background.Mohammed Salem also added that Muhammad and his wife were also killed in this house- it is possible that he could refer to Muhammad Iyad Salem who was mentioned in the list of victims published by Emad j abushawiesh.A niece of the late Ziad, Abed Deeb, wrote a heartfelt Facebook testimony, mourning the death of her dear uncle Ziad, his wife and children.Mohammed b Salem in his post wished “Mercy on the family of my aunt Umm Wissam, her husband Ziad, her children, her grandchildren, and her children’s wives 💔😭.”Hamed jawad mahdi posted a tribute for Basil Ziad Salem, calling him “the beloved and dear friend to our hearts.”Shaimaa Akram Salem, her husband and children were mentioned also in the testimony by Ana Safaa.Umm Bashir’s houseAccording to a post by Mohammed Salem, the three women belonging to three different generations were killed in the house of his aunt Umm Bashir, in particular, Haji Noha Saeed Salem was killed alongside her daughter Reham Saeed Salem and Reham’s daughter Haji Hanan Saeed Salem.Among the civilians killed in this house were a mother Khader Salem (umm Basil), her three sons – Basil Rafiq Salem, Jihad Rafiq Salem and Ahmed Rafiq Salem and her daughter Farah Rafiq Salem. At the same time, Khader’s husband Rafiq Salem (Abu Basil), their married daughters, and Basil’s wife and daughter survived.Khitam Saeed Salem, child of Saeed Salem was also listed as civilians killed by Yahya Salim and Emad j AbushawieshThaer Mounir Salem was killed alongside his mother, his wife, his brothers Muhammad Mounir Salem, Ammar Mounir Salem and Omar Mounir Salem (Omar was identified in Yahya Salim’s list of victims) and his sister Shahd Mounir Salem. Thaer and his siblings’ father Abu Thaer survived.Rizq Salem’s (Abu Nidal) houseAccording to Mohammed Salem, his uncle Muhammad Rizq Salem (Abu Nidal) was killed alongside his wife, their son Alaa Muhammad Salem, their daughter Amani Muhammad Salem and their two grandchildren, sons of their surviving son Nidal – Muhammad Nidal Salem and Ahmed Nidal Salem. He stated that Nidal Salem, his wife and two daughters survived. However, Yahya Salim and Emad j Abushawiesh’s list of victims included Nidal Muhammad Salem as one of those killed, with the following relatives: Fidaa Muhammad Salem, Nihad Muhammad Salem, and Kafah Muhammad Salem (mentioned below).Abu Iyad’s houseAccording to Mohammed Salem, Mahmoud Abdel Karim Salem (Abu Ahmed) was killed alongside his wife and all their four children. The names of his deceased children were Ahmed Mahmoud Salem, Mohamed Mahmoud Salem, and Ibrahim Mahmoud Salem, the name of the fourth child was not provided. It could possibly be Kafah Muhammad Salem as his name was listed right below those of the three brothers identified in the list provided by Mohammed Salem- in case there was a typo in the writing of Kafah’s middle Arabic name (Mohammad instead of Mahmoud – only one letter different in Arabic).Abed Deeb mourned the loss of her cousin Mahmoud Abdel Karim Salem (Abu Ahmed) and his entire family. She added many images of the family members – mostly men of different ages, but it is hard to identify exactly who was portrayed in the pictures.Additional members of the Salem familyThere were additional members of the Salem family mentioned in the testimonies by Yahya Salim and Emad j Abushawiesh as killed, but absent in the post by Mohammed Salem. In particular, those were identified as Moaz Hossam Salem, Lana Hossam Salem, Baraa Hossam Salem – children of Hossam Salem, and Muhammad Iyad Salem (on Muhammad Iyad Salem, see section Ziad Salem (Abu Wissam)’s house), Muhammad Suleiman Salem, Wisam Al-Khawaldeh, Nesma Hani Salem.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to the Israeli military.*When victims were referred to as “children of” Airwars counted them as children given the context and understanding of the family in this case, unless there was evidence to suggest at their age (such as marital status). Where only names were identified without ages, Airwars counted these as adults. Our civilian casualty ranges will be updated once more information is available.

According to messages posted on social media, the family had been besieged in their home since December 4th, when the IDF entered the area of Bani Suhaila, east of Khan Younis. Three bodies – believed to be those of Duwaila Muhammad Abu Anza and her daughters Tasneem Hamdan Abu Libdeh and Shahad Hamdan Abu Libdeh – were found in the following weeks near the family’s home. Duwaila’s husband, Hamdan Muhammad Abu Libdeh, son, Islam Hamdan Abu Libdeh and daughters Razan Hamdan Abu Libdeh and Reem Hamdan Abu Libdeh, who was an associate trustee of the MSF UK Board, are thought to have been killed as well.The fate of the Abu Libdeh family is known through a detailed testimony of the only surviving member, Hala Abu Libdeh, who was living in the United Kingdom as a Chevening Scholar at the time of the attack. In an interview with Palestine Deep Dive, Hala described her struggle to locate her family after losing contact with them on December 12th.Close family friends confirmed contact with the Abu Libdeh family was lost this day through various social media posts. Trying to locate them, the user Isramudallal posted on Facebook: “The family of Hamdan Muhammad Abu Libda (Abu Islam) has been besieged in Bani Suhaila since December 4, the beginning of the ground invasion of the eastern region of Khan Yunis. Contact with them has been cut off since December 12”. The post included several contact numbers and a recent photo of Hamdan Muhammad Abu Libdeh.Hala Abu Libdeh tried to reach out to her neighbours without a response. Local news outlets were also silent. “It was like this area just disappeared”. A few days later Hala managed to talk with an ICRC representative who confirmed they had tried to evacuate her family, but an Israeli tank was blocking the entrance.45 days passed until Hala received news of her family. Social media posts where the Abu Libdeh family was declared “martyred” started circulating on January 26th. “Nearly more than a month after communication with them was cut off, the news of the martyrdom of my friend Shahad Hamdan Abu Lebda and all her family members was confirmed”, wrote Alaa Mahdi Qudeh in a Facebook post. “In the worst nightmares of my life, I did not imagine that I would lose my friend and lifelong companion in this way, and that there would no longer even be a grave or trace of them”.Other social media users reported that a body had later been found in the Abu Libdeh family house, and buried in the Al-Awda School, where Hala and her sisters studied for secondary school.A video shared on several Twitter/X accounts shows what is believed to be Shahad Hamdan’s body under sheets. According to testimonies received by Hala Abu Libdeh of people who had been at the scene, several bullets were found near the body, leading them to believe they had found a victim of execution.Hala Abu Libdeh, who later received an extended version of this video, also corroborated that her family home was allegedly damaged both by airstrikes and tank artillery. According to comments made by her in the Palestine Deep Dive interview, a garden that surrounded the house and a high fence had “disappeared”. “Part of the fence was inside the house and there are no walls,” Hala said. “There’s also a possibility that they crushed my family under the tanks”.“My friend had a very tender heart, a pure soul, and an innocent face. She was light-hearted and joking a lot. She was cheerful and loved to laugh and live, and she often liked to hug me and I did too. She always knew how much I hated the color grey, as she did. We always loved clarity, laughed and cried a lot together and were also afraid a lot together”, wrote Alaa Mahdi Kudaih in a condolence message posted on Facebook. Still uncertain of whether the body found was Shehad’s, she continued: “I still do not know the fate of my friend, and even if it is suspected that the characteristics of the hair of the first decomposing corpse may, in large part, belong to her, I do not accept this departure, I will not accept it, I cannot, I am weaker than all of this. I want to see my friend’s face, even if it’s one last time, take a final farewell look, kiss her one last time, hug her one last time, and tell her I love you one last time, even if all of this is from behind the phone screen. Is it too much for my heart to ask?”.A week later, two more bodies were found in an open area of a factory near the Abu Libdeh family home. A close family friend was able to recognise the body of Duwaila Muhammad Abu Anza. It was assumed, based on the assessment of other relatives, that the second body found in the area was Tasneem Hamdan Abu Libdeh’s. This close family friend also recognised a bandage around Duwaila’s head.Due to the still imminent danger in the area, these bodies could not be recovered until weeks later, when they were brought to Rafah. As the only close family member who had survived, Hala Abu Libdeh was faced with the terrible task of trying to recognise her loved ones through photos of their bodies sent from Gaza.“I used to tell my sisters: ‘Don’t send me your photo if you are not smiling in the photo’. But I’ve never imagined that I will crop their smiles and send the photos to people to recognise who’s the body for from the teeth, because the bodies were decomposed to the point that even my relatives weren’t able to identify who’s the body for”.Although the bodies of Hamdan Muhammad, Islam Hamdan, Razan Hamdan and Reem Hamdan have not been found, the devastation of the family home and months without any news of their whereabouts do not leave much room for hope. After the interview with Palestine Deep Dive, Hala mentioned to the same media outlet that some neighbours had managed to return to the house and had found clothes belonging to her brother covered in blood.The Abu Libdeh family received numerous condolences through social media posts. On March 5th 2024, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) expressed their grief on their official website and Twitter accounts: “Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is devastated about the death of Reem Abu Lebdeh, an associate trustee of the MSF UK Board and former staff member in Gaza, whom we believe was killed sometime in December 2023”. According to MSF, “Reem worked as a physiotherapist for MSF in Gaza from 2018 until 2022, and last year was appointed as an associate trustee of the MSF UK Board”.The user Isramudallal posted on Facebook: “Here Gaza is screaming and the world is silent…if only the world would be silent once and listen. It is not the only message.. and it is not the first time.. I often post an appeal, and either you send me the news of “we met them,” “they are fine,” “they are alive,” or “they were martyred,” O Israa 💔 These are the destinies of God…and the world’s desire to kill us”.Hamdan Muhammad Abu Libdeh, who had studied Mathematics in Jordan and Duwaila Muhammad Abu Anza, who earned a degree in Arabic Literature from the Al-Azhar University in Cairo, emigrated to Saudi Arabia and worked as teachers there for nearly 20 years before returning to Gaza. According to Hala Abu Libdeh, Hamdan Muhammad struggled to find a teaching job in Gaza and more recently worked as a taxi driver.Their children were also highly educated and dedicated professionals.Reem Hamdan Abu Libdeh studied physiotherapy and went on to work for several international organisations including Mercy Corps and MSF, where she was an associate trustee of the board. She was “very keen to help people in the community” and had been involved in a project for MSF France that developed 3D-printed masks for face burns.Islam Hamdan Abu Libdeh was a civil engineer who worked in Gaza for Action Against Hunger and the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics. He graduated with honours and enjoyed playing chess. Hala encouraged Islam to pursue a career in voice acting, which he had already been doing before October 7th.Tasneem Hamdan Abu Libdeh studied medicine at Ain Shams University in Egypt, where she graduated with the highest honours. She was planning on becoming an cardiologist, and she had recently moved to Gaza to prepare for her specialisation.Razan Hamdan Abu Libdeh was also a doctor, having earned her degree from Kasr Al Ainy Medical School at Cairo University. During her senior year of high school, she received a scholarship from the Leonard Education Foundation. Razan worked in different hospitals in Khan Younis. Noting the need for female gynaecologists in Gaza, she decided to pursue this speciality and continue her studies abroad, hoping to open a specialised centre upon her return. Before her death, she was planning to apply for a Chevening Scholarship.According to her sister Hala, Shahad Hamdan Abu Libdeh was only 16 when she developed a device capable of generating electrical energy from the light of a candle. She went on to study Software Engineering at the Islamic University of Gaza, where she graduated with honours just in September 2023.Where sources attributed the attack to a belligerent, all sources identified Israel as responsible.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeGround operationCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed3 – 7(3–5 women0–2 men0–2 healthcare_personnel)Causes of injury / deathDenial of access to/destruction of objects indispensable to survival, Heavy weapons and explosive munitions, Small arms and light weaponsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducation,HealthcareImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

Victims were transported to Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital.A post by a relative of the family (هذيان ذاكرة, source listed as a.ar.hk) listed the members of the Khalifa family that were killed in the airstrike, including Suzanne Ramadan Khalifa and Shada Ramadan Khalifa.The same source identified pharmacist Dr Iman (Khalifa) Abu Batnin, the wife of Mohammed Ramadan Khalifa, also killed alongside their five children: three girls, Sana Mohammad Khalifa, Hala Mohammad Khalifa and Hana Mohammad Khalifa, and two boys, Abdullah Mohammad Khalifa and Youssef Mohammad Khalifa were also killed in the incident. These five victims all appear to be the children of the journalist Mohammed Ramadan Khalifa, however multiple sources specifically reported that only three of his children were killed in the incident.a.ar.hk also reported that her uncle Muhammad Youssef Ali al-Attar, who was a professor, was killed alongside her aunt Zahr Youssef Ali al-Attar, who was also an educator, and her aunt’s husband Ahmed Hamad (Abu Al-Abd). Their son, Shada Khalifa’s husband, Abdul Latif Ahmed Hamad, who was an engineer, and was reportedly killed alongside his sisters Dr Alaa Ahmed Hamad and professor Duaa Ahmed Hamad. Another victim, described by a.ar.hk as her sister’s husband, Mr Adham Ahmed Al-Batniji, was killed alongside his son, Adam (or Adham) Adham Al-Batniji.Siblings Basim Yahya Khalifa and Ahmed Yahya Khalifa were also among those killed.Two infants survived the strike: 11-month-old Ahmed Mohamed Khalifa, son of Mohammad Ramadan Khalifa, and 9-month-old Ahmed Abdel Latif Hamad, the infant son of Shada Ramadan Khalifa and Abdel Latif Ahmed Hamad, who was displaced with the journalist’s wife’s family. The strike “threw them outside the house” according to source Muthana Naiiar. Both have been listed as injured based on the description and images of them in the hospital.Mohammad Khalifa’s father, who is 65 years old, recounted the incident of the bombing to Al Jazeera. He described the moment, stating, “We were sitting quietly and preparing ourselves for sleep. The house and everyone in it was bombed”. He talked about the death of his son, “My eldest son was killed while he was working as a journalist, along with his children”.The father also mentioned the circumstances in their home at the time of the attack, indicating that the house was occupied by approximately 50 people, including displaced relatives and friends from the north. The Khalifa family had been hosting the Al Asar family and Hamad family at the time of the incident, according to Al Jazeera. He also mentioned a child who survived the bombing.Friends and relatives posted tributes to the victims on social media. A university friend of Shada Ramadan Khalifa, named Roba A El-Farra‎‏, described Shada in a post on Facebook as “one of the kindest and most affectionate people I have ever known in my life”. She described Shada’s joy at the birth of her first son Ahmed and her dream of completing her Master’s degree. Roba wrote of her disbelief at the death of her friend and distress that Shada had died while her infant son survived, writing “I still can’t understand it”.Shada, Suzan and Mohammed’s sister, responding to posts on the account a.ar.hk on Facebook, paid tribute to two of the young victims, brothers Bassim and Ahmed Yahya Khalifa. Describing Bassim she wrote, “You were a true man, despite your young age, an example of politeness and respect that is rarely matched in our time” and of Ahmed she wrote that she had named her own son after him because of her love for him. Alongside the post, this family member shared images of the boys, dressed in suits for a special occasion – both appear to be under the age of 18.Many accounts reported Mohammed Ramadan Khalifa’s death and described his career as a director and a journalist. He had been the director of a TV series called “Al-Fada’i” that had aired during Ramadan a number of years prior, according to reports by Nabd News.The article on the incident by Al Jazeera included images that showed the immense scale of destruction to the family home and the surrounding area and civilians can be seen staring into the rubble left behind.AP News mentioned that a funeral was held at Al Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital’s courtyard the next day, while rescue teams kept searching for survivors.Where possible, names have been reconciled with published Palestinian Ministry of Health lists released between October 26th but before the July 24th list (which has not yet been checked by Airwars teams). Airwars has not included the ages listed for the majority of matches, as the ages listed in the MoH list do not match the descriptions of the victims.Where sources mentioned a belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike and/or ArtilleryCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed19(8 children6 women5 men1 journalist)Civilians reported injured12–24Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducation,HealthcareImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

Mahmoud Basal added that 76 members of the family were killed, and stated that the alleged strike was believed to be “one the deadliest in the war.”The Associated Press reported that “on Friday, airstrikes flattened two homes, one in Gaza City and the other in the urban refugee camp of Nuseirat in the center of the territory,” with the Gaza City strike killing 76. AP added that the Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Friday that the army carried out airstrikes against Hamas fighters in several locations of Gaza City. The Guardian stated that the Israel’s military “did not immediately respond” to the civilian harm claims of the alleged strike.Al Jazeera further reported that the alleged strike was part of an “intensified bombardment since Friday’s UN Security Council resolution that has been criticised as ‘woefully insufficient.’”The New York Times posted that a UN aid worker and “more than 70 members of his extended family” were killed, noting that on the same day aid agencies “sharply criticized the UN Security Council for passing a resolution that did not call for a full cease-fire.”UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner released a statement, in which he announced the death of Issam Mohammed al-Maghribi (56), Issam’s wife Lamia Jawdat al-Maghribi (53), their daughters Suad (30) and Lama (27), their sons Louay (23), and Obaideh (13), and Mohammad Essam al-Maghribi (32), Mohammed’s wife, and his sons Moatasem and Asid. Steiner’s statement reported that they were “killed by an Israeli airstrike near Gaza City today”, along with over 70 members of their extended family. Steiner stated that Issam had worked with UNDP through their Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian people for over 30 years, that “he will be remembered as a beloved member of the PAPP team”, and that the loss had deeply affected them. Adding that “no more families should endure the pain and suffering that Issam’s family and countless others are experiencing”, that the war must end and that the UN and civilians in Gaza were “not a target.”UNDP Jordan organized a moment of silence to mourn the death of Issam and his family “as a result of an Israeli air strike near Gaza City”, and extended their condolences. The World Health Organization’s Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus offered his condolences, stating in a post on Twitter/X that “humanitarians should never be victims” and called for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres posted to Twitter/X the day following the alleged strike, saying “136 of our colleagues in Gaza have been killed in 75 days – something we have never seen in UN history./Most of our staff have been forced from their homes./I pay tribute to them & the thousands of aid workers risking their lives as they support civilians in Gaza.”The names of 79 of the civilians killed in the alleged strike were shared by relatives and loved ones on social media – in addition to the family of Issam al-Mahribi mentioned above, the following names were shared.The elderly Jawdat Darwish al-Maghribi (Abu Darwish), Ahmed Jawdat al-Maghribi, Ahmed’s two wives, his five sons Fadi, Rafi, Zein, Abdullah, and Moataz were killed.

May God give you patience, my beloved, Uncle Saud.” In another post, Mohammed al-Saafeen shared the words of Saud al-Lababdi who lost his family, his wife, all his children, and all his grandchildren – “Alone, thank God’ with three heart-stopping words, our beloved brother Saud Al-Lababidi mourned for us his entire family…He mourned them when he was nearly seventy years old, sitting alone between the walls of his simple house in al-Shati refugee camp, from which the family had fled to escape the hell of war, and he remained in it, that house that I had known for thirty-five years and lived through all the stages of life in it, their efforts to rebuild it brick by brick and stone by stone, decorating it. simple with their own hands. The hustle and bustle of life and the love that filled it, the children’s efforts to work in the summer to help their parents, the beauty of the family gathered together during the days of Ramadan and other days, the great love that Abu Muhammad’s eyes expressed when he called Umm Muhammad to greet us and his intense fear for her due to her illness, his wishes to travel for Hajj with her. The great generosity that characterized the entire family despite the difficult circumstances, and much more. We have lost nearly thirty loved ones from a family that is in fact part of our family in every sense of the word. I used to eat and sleep in their house, and I found them to be my refuge from all distress…This pain is too severe to bear, and this loss is too severe to pass by.”Saud al-Lababidi was reported as killed by Souna al-Lababidi and has been recorded in the civilian casualty recording for this incident.Mohammed al-Saafeen shared another post with images of Muhammad Saud and his children in an alley, and an image of the rubble and destruction in the aftermath, captioned “Before their (displacement and death)., Muhammad Saud sent me this picture. Behind him were his sons and nephews playing. One of them was looking at the sky and perhaps saw a plane or a missile descending from it. Like these children, I do not think that the explosion of the missile or the demolition of this house over their heads took their lives. I know them. Up close, I know their tender bodies and their tender hearts that might have stopped in fear of the burning fire or the terrifying sound.”Hema Salama shared images of Muhammad Saud in a post saying “My brother, my lover, my friend, the apple of my eye, my companion at work, and in everything, you left me and went away. How do I want to work after today? Who do I want to sit with after today?….Abu Ahmed and all the family members, his brother, all the family members, his mother, and his sisters are gone.”Images shared by relatives on social media showed memories of a joyful family, pictures of the elderly and children alike, laughing, in school, at home, and celebrating together.Saif Eddin al-Agha posted “this is an example of what the situation has become in Gaza and an example of what happens every day and not a single hair is shaken by this unjust world” and that the bombing of “one house containing displaced members of the family led to the martyrdom of all of them (81 people, including 17 women and 49 children)…”Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed79 – 81(49 children17–19 women15–16 men)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducation,Food,HealthcareImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

The Israeli military which acknowledged the attack, claiming that it was targeting Hamas operatives. Israeli forces admitted to the “unintended” harm to civilians, due to “mistakenly” having hit adjacent structures. Military officials also reported that they had used the wrong weapon.The airstrikes hit residential homes in a block in Al-Maghazi camp near Deir al Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Most sources reported on the strikes after 11pm local time, though Safa news in their reporting put timestamps of 7.57pm when mentioning strikes on the Al-Nawasrah family home in the Maghazi camp. By 9.10pm, the same source reported that two other family homes had also been hit – belonging to the Muslim (Musallam) and Sisalem families, killing at least 15 civilians.Other sources reporting on the Muslim family often identified the Ghaban family home as having been hit at the same time, while Facebook user Mohammad Ghanam also reported two other homes had been hit; belonging to the Abu Hamida family and the family home of Professor Abu Iyad Abu Rahma.Speaking to Unicorn Riot, Mahmoud Abu Rahma, a survivor of the incident, said: “Suddenly we were targeted by a very huge missile, and we could not see anything, and fog prevailed everywhere. As we tried to inhale the air, smoke entered our mouths. We fled, not knowing where to go, and our hands and feet were torn apart. The hands of the children and adults and everyone in the place were torn. Thank God we got out in peace, but I don’t know what to say.”Mahmoud Abu Rahma went on to say that residents of the Maghazi Refugee Camp never received any warning to evacuate. He also described the bombing as “more massive and horrific destruction than we had ever imagined before.”Another surviving resident, Ashraf al-Haj Ahmed, told Al Jazeera that the attack happened suddenly and without any prior warning. “At around 11:30pm that night, we witnessed a series of large explosions that shook the entire camp”. His relative’s home was among those that were flattened to the ground. Al-Haj Ahmed recalled running towards it as soon as the bombardment woke him up, just a few blocks down. At the scene of the attack, he found a four-story building destroyed “on top of those who were living in it”.A Facebook user Mohammad Hazem Al-Masry shared a picture of the dead bodies covered with white cloth lying of the ground in front of a building, possibly a hospital. Raya FM reported that the Abu Rahma family home was behind the Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq Mosque in Al-Maghazi camp.A survivor told the Times of Gaza: “We had around 100 people taking refuge in our home. Suddenly while we were peacefully in the house – we were all civilians, and it was mostly children who were killed. We saw missiles falling on our heads.”Al Jazeera shared an image by Adel Hana showing the outside of an al-Nawasrah family home that was destroyed in the attack. A series of images taken by Ali Jadallah for Anadolu Agency and shared by Al Jazeera showed men and children looking at the rubble left from one of the buildings and women returning to their neighbourhood just to find rubble.Death tollsLocal resident Ahmed Maghari told Al Jazeera journalists that many victims were difficult to identify: “We pulled out so many body parts that we can’t even estimate the total number of deaths yet,” Maghari said. “They’re all in pieces, and we’re pulling them out with our bare hands,” he added. “We’ve now gathered at least two piles of body parts.”Referring to the government media office in Gaza, soon after the incident Alghad TV reported that more than 66 civilians had been killed as a result of the attack. Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital officials said that 68 civilians, including at least 12 women and seven children, had died as reported by Associated Press on December 24, 2023. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights alleged that at least 86 people were killed in the attack, and many more were injured. Handwritten hospital records later obtained by the Associated Press indicated that 106 people had been killed across eight different families.At the time, spokesman for the Ministry of Health in Gaza, Ashraf al Qudra, said that the number of people killed was expected to rise and accused Israel of “carrying out a massacre in a densely populated residential area”. Entire residential blocks were wiped out. “In each home, there’s a minimum of 50 people.” Ahmed Maghari, another Maghazi resident, told Al Jazeera. “A lot of them are displaced Palestinians from other parts of Gaza who were forced to flee their homes.”The death toll rose after more bodies were recovered from the rubble. A Facebook user Moaz Ismail reported that there were 100 victims of the attack, sharing an image of the funeral were dozens of bodies in white shrouds are seen lying on the ground surrounded by large crowd of mourners, engaged in funeral prayers. Al Jazeera also shared a striking image showing the funeral from above, while an image by Ashraf Amra for Anadolu Agency showed an injured man lying on a stretcher attending a funeral. In another report Al Jazeera shared an image of a Palestinian woman dressed in black, grieving over the bodies of her loved ones.Al Jazeera Palestine shared a Facebook video also showing dozens of bodies in white shrouds with the inscription “68 martyrs from one family”. The video showed a man lying on the ground, embracing a dead body of his loved one.A Twitter/X video by @sI3RAlpzpeAAjjv also showed bodies of the dozens of victims in the hospital of Al-Aqsa and people who came to search for their relatives. A Twitter/X account @palestino_free shared a graphic image of a dead infant accompanying a caption relating the image to the incident in Al-Maghazi camp.Two sources, @TamamBeitJirja and @RamAbdu, alleged that Israeli forces later fired on mourners at the funeral for the al-Nawasra family in the Al-Maghazi cemetery the next day, on Decemeber 25th 2023, reportedly killing 5 people.Names identifiedAirwars gathered names from testimonies of family relatives posted after the incident, with a number of details shared in a Facebook post by Beit Hanoun about casualties within the Nasser Family. This testimony as well as tributes by the family relatives Dina Nasser and Hassan Nasser helped to identify some victims of the deadly bombardment and their family connections. 49 civilians killed in this strike have been identified by Airwars researchers so far.Dina’s and Hassan’s uncle Samih Ali Nasser (Abu Imad) was killed alongside his wife and their five children – three sons (one of them named Badr Samih Nasser) and two daughters. Samih’s sister and wife of the late Jamal Abd Rabbo Al-Zaanin, Naima Ali Nasser was also killed along with her four children – a daughter and three sons. Dina’s cousin and nephew of Samih, Haitham Hani Nasser (Abu Yahya) was killed along with his children, a son called Yahya and a daughter named Nour. Beit Hanoun City shared an image of the late Samih – a middle-aged man in a black shirt and a grey suit.Another of Dina’s aunts, the wife of Maher Al-Shanbari, Rawda Ali Nasser (Umm Qusay) was also killed alongside her three children – a son and two daughters. The death of Rawda was mourned in a tribute by AWDA Health & Community Association where she was remembered as a nurse and colleague who used to work at the Al Awda Health and Community Center – Beit Hanoun. AWDA wrote “to the martyrs who are more honorable than us all… a thousand mercy” and shared an image of Rawda, a middle aged woman in a white hijab.Hassan’s three cousins were killed with their families: Iyad Rafiq Hussein Nasser (Abu Mahdi) was killed alongside his wife and their nine children (one of them Doua Iyad Rafiq Nasser); Muhammad Rafiq Hussein Nasser (Abu Arab) was killed alongside his nine family members, including his son Arafat Muhammad Rafiq Nasser; and Hussein Rafiq Hussein Nasser (Abu Jihad) was killed alongside all his family members. It is possible that some of these family members are accounted for in the previous tally – Airwars has taken a conservative approach in our lower estimates to avoid duplication.Nidal Rafiq Hussein Nasser was also named among those killed, alongside all his family members including his only daughter. Ahmed Fouad Abdel Hadi Nasser (Abu Amin) was killed along with his niece Mai Jihad Fouad Nasser, and his cousin Ahmed Rafiq Hussein Nasser.Al-hawaneen center shared some images of the victims on Facebook, including Ahmed Fouad Nasser, Haitham Hani Nasser and Badr Samih Nasser. From the images Ahmed and Badr appear as middle aged men while Haitham looks very young, possibly a teenager.The founder of the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund Steve Sosebee posted a memorial for Izzeddin Nawasrah who was killed in the bombing of Maghazi and told his story: “Izzeddin was 16y in 2018 when an Israeli sniper shot him in the leg during a Great Return March protest in Gaza…. He lost his leg and forever was to live as a cripple. We wanted to get him walking again so he could finish school.” Izzeddin came to the US for care in 2019. “Izzeddin came without his family and was welcomed by the Palestinian community in Harrisburg, PA. He stayed for months, having a new leg built and learning to walk again. During his time in the US Izzeddin learned to represent the youth of Gaza. He was always smiling and positive, despite his injury, and trying to inspire other young people. He learned to give speeches and inspire others. Once Izzeddin returned home, I started a group with 10 other amputees who we treated over the years and they called themselves “We Can!” I started to mentor them on how to run humanitarian programs and projects, especially food distributions for poor people in Gaza’s camps. We also created an amputee program in Gaza, which Izzeddin played an important role. Hundreds of kids with limb deficiencies joined together to support each other and created a community… Izzeddin had a special talent in taking photos so we trained him in that so he could support our communications efforts. He was good. The murder of this shining young man is just one of countless stories of senseless death and misery. We cannot let the killing of Izzeddin to stop us.”In a post on Facebook, published the morning after the incident, Ahmad Ghanam Abu Akar reported the death of Nidaa Al-Hajj Ahmed and five of her young children. Four daughters named Nidaa, Lian, Lana and Rana as well as her six-month-old boy, Hamada. Abu Akar offered his condolences to Nidaa’s husband, Ibrahim Al-Hajj Youssef, and their eldest son, Muhammed, who survived the incident but had been injured. Abu Akar reported that the bodies of Nidaa and her five children had not yet been recovered.Among the victims of the strikes was a Palestinian artist, playwright and actor named Ahed Abu Hamda. He was 25 years old and a drama teacher who worked with Theatre Days, a Gaza-based community theatre. His death was reported by the organization Artists On The Frontline reported on Wednesday, 27th December. Candid images posted on social media showed Ahed in a theatre engaging in some drama training with other young people.An elderly man named Hajj Ahmed Hassan Abdel-Jawad was reportedly killed amongst others killed and injured in the bombing that hit the Abu Rahma family home. A Facebook page called Al-Maghazi Now reported his death and posted a picture of him from before the incident.Injured civiliansReferencing the government media office in Gaza, Alghad TV reported that dozens of civilians were also injured as a result of the attack on al-Maghazi camp. A Facebook user Rashed Kabariti also wrote about dozens of injured civilians recovered after the strike on the homes of Musallam, Sisalem, and al-Nawasra Families.A video shared by Al Jazeera Egypt on Facebook showed rescue efforts and how injured civilians were evacuated from the place of the airstrike. A video posted by Ahmad El Hajj on Twitter/X showed how a group of men were carrying out a body (unclear whether a person was injured or killed) to an ambulance in the darkness. Similarly, Twitter/X user Heba rawashdeh shared images of men carrying a person on a stretcher in the darkness.The Palestinian Red Crescent published footage from al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, in Deir al-Balah, showing dazed and bloodied children covered in dust. There were also dozens of white body bags.Alhaya media also shared images of injured children and adults taken by Hani Abourezq for Al-Hayat Al-Jadeeda. They featured a girl with a damaged eye and a big scar across her forehead, a small girl with a bandaged head, another small girl with a head injury and an elderly woman covered with dust with a wound on her forehead.Associated Press journalists at a hospital in Deir al-Balah watched frantic Palestinians carry the dead, including a baby, and other wounded individuals. One bloodied young girl looked stunned while her body was checked for broken bones.Among the injured was a daughter of Abu Rami Abu al-Ais who shared his story with Al Jazeera. Abu Rami said that he and his family had been sheltering in Maghazi ever since he left his home in the al-Zahra neighbourhood. “We had a home in al-Zahra, which came under attack. After coming here, the house we were staying in was bombed again.”Aftermath of the strikes and rescue effortsAl-Maghazi camp is one of the most densely populated refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, hosting many displaced people from Northern Gaza. An article published by Al Jazeera reported that, according to the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNWRA), the camp typically housed around 30,000 people but had grown to over 100,000 due to the displacement of residents from the north of the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the campaign.Describing the aftermath of the strikes, Al Jazeera wrote that residents of the camp returned to their neighbourhood to find only blocks of concrete lying where their homes had stood. “These houses are destroyed. Our house was bombed,” Abu Rami Abu al-Ais commented to Al Jazeera on Monday, December 25th, standing in the debris. Another survivor, who lost several family members in the incident told AP “There’s no safe place in the Gaza Strip.”Himyar media shared striking images taken for Reuters that showed the widespread destruction of the buildings in the al-Maghazi camp from above.Abu Rami Abu al-Ais, a displaced person who had been sheltering in al-Maghazi camp, told Al Jazeera that people were still collecting the remains of their friends, neighbours and relatives with their bare hands.“We found the remains of women and children who were blown up. Their body parts have been scattered over a span of about three blocks,” due to the intensity of the strikes, al-Ais said. “It was a very dark and painful night for Maghazi,” he recalled. “The widespread and sheer destruction is indescribable.”Al-Ais also added that there were no excavators that could help speed up the process of recovering people from under the blocks of concrete. The lack of much-needed fuel to operate bulldozers and vehicles meant that – just like civil defence teams in Gaza – residents were digging with their bare hands to attempt to recover as many victims from under the rubble as they can.A number of videos showing the rescue efforts and excavation of dead bodies were shared on social media. A video shared by Twitter/X account @zamanalwsl showed how local residents were searching the rubble for survivors. A very graphic video shared by Twitter/X account @sa12yj showed a dead body of a young man or a teenager found amidst the rubble and being taken away by a group of men. A Facebook video shared by Al Jazeera Palestine captured the rescue efforts and the moment that people see a hand of the victim under the concrete block – but it is not clear whether this person was dead or alive.Reaction from the Israeli militaryIn a statement sent to CNN and other media, the Israeli military (the IDF) confirmed that they were responsible for the strikes: “During operations in the Gaza Strip against Hamas terrorist targets, IAF fighter jets struck two targets adjacent to which Hamas operatives were located on December 24, 2023.”“Before the strikes were carried out, steps were taken by the IDF to mitigate harm to uninvolved civilians in the area. A preliminary investigation revealed that additional buildings located near the targets were also hit during the strikes, which likely caused unintended harm to uninvolved civilians,” the IDF said further as reported by CNN on December 28, 2023.According to the Israeli media outlet Haaretz, on Thursday, December 28, 2023, Kan public broadcaster reported that, according to a Israeli military official, “the type of munition did not match the nature of the attack, so extensive collateral damage was caused – which could have been avoided.”Associated Press also reported that Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, told Britain’s Sky News that the wrong munition was used in the strike, leading to “a regrettable mistake.”CNN reported that IDF had said the strikes would be further investigated by the General Staff’s Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism. The Times of Israel reported that the army “regret(ted) the harm caused to uninvolved civilians and was acting to draw conclusions and learn lessons from this event”.At the time of publication of this incident, the outcome of the investigation has not been made public.Name reconciliationWhere possible, names have been reconciled with published Palestinian Ministry of Health lists. With thanks to journalist Alexandre Horn from CheckNews for identifying relevant sources, and Data Tech for Palestine for centralising the datasets. In the process of reconciliation it became clear that the surnames Nasser and al-Nawasrah are used interchangeably and refer to the same family.

The Middle East Eye reported that five children had been killed in the alleged strike, and that bodies were “scattered throughout the area”, and in another post shared images of five wounded children being treated for their injuries.The Ministry of Health spokesperson Ashraf al-Qedra stated to Xinhua that the death toll could rise further as the search for survivors beneath the rubble “of a residential building near al-Amal hospital” continued, and warned against alleged “deliberate targeting” of the Nasser Medical Complex and it’s vicinity in Khan Yunis. Xinhua reported that local sources informed them that “there were many displaced Palestinians inside the building” when the alleged strike occurred, and that rescuers at the site said “most of the victims were retrieved in ‘dismembered parts.’”Users on social media shared the names of the identified civilians among those killed. Khaleel Ibrahim shared nine names of those killed “in the bombing of a house for the Hamdan family, opposite the eastern gate of the Red Crescent Society” – Ibrahim Tayseer Salah Hamdan, Suhail Abdel Fattah Issa, Shadi Saqr Fayad, Makram Akram Shannan, Sally Ghlais al-Ghaf Shannan, Tayseer Eid Saleh Wafi, Aisha Magdy al-Hassi, and the children Farid Mahmoud Ghaf and Yazan Hussein al-Majdalawi. Farid’s mother Mariam Saleh Joudeh Marouf was also killed in the attack. Tamas Abdallah posted that three children had been identified among those killed, but only named Yazan and Farid.Tributes to Shadi Fayad and Suhail Issa were posted by their loved ones on social media – Khaled Issa called his uncle Suhail “a kind man, the owner of the good memory”, while Nadal Issa shared a photo of Suhail, a smiling, bearded man wearing a cap. Mosab a Fayyad, Arees Alabadla, and the Facebook page al-Qarara’s pulse shared images of Shadi Fayad, a young man with a bright smile, with al-Qarara calling him “the righteous son of Qarara” and Arees saying Shadi was reunited with his mother and sister “in the highest paradise”, and expressed condolences to his surviving sister and family.In a Twitter/X post, the Palestine Red Crescent Society alleged that the PRCS-run al-Amal hospital had been bombed “for the fifth time in less than a week”, sharing a video documenting their work following the alleged strike on Thursday. In it, a PRCS worker stated that on the morning of Thursday, they were at the Khan Yunis ambulance center when they “heard several explosions nearby” which they gradually confirmed to be as a result of “a bombardment on a residential apartment east of al-Amal hospital”, with simultaneous “artillery shelling on al-Qassam street” the latter for which EMS teams retrieved a body and provided “initial first aid to the cases in the field.” They further informed that according to protocol, injuries were directed to the nearest available hospital, al-Amal, with the “extremely critical cases” being redirected to Nasser Hospital “for more effective management of the situation.”A video shared by Blue Globe World News showed about five injured, including three children, being taken into Nasser hospital – the children weeping in distress, one with wounds on their limbs and face. The Times of Gaza shared an image of a doctor at Nasser Hospital in Gaza treating a heavily wounded man while on the floor, quoting the doctor “Today, I have this floor to sit on, and maybe it won’t be there tomorrow.” The Times also shared a video of a man collapsing in grief at the hospital, wailing “We can’t take it anymore.”Another video, shared by @jala_leb, showed a toddler with a severely wounded leg crying and shivering in pain while being comforted by a man.Amr Tabash shared a heartbreaking video of Farid Ghaf’s grieving father, weeping and carrying the body of his child wrapped in a shroud.

Later, the agency tweeted the statement of the Palestinian Red Crescent condemning the killing of its four crew members. The PRCS also announced that two patients who were transported in the ambulance were injured and died of their injuries.According to the PRCS, the ambulance had been on Salah al-Din Road, a highway running north-south through the Gaza Strip that has in the past been used by thousands of Palestinians fleeing the Israeli military advance. The members of the crew killed in the incident included the ambulance driver, Youssef Abdullah Muhammad Muammar, the paramedic Fadi Fouad Al-Maani, the first responder, 24-year-old Islam Abu Riala, and a volunteer photographer Fouad Abu Khammash.Akhbar Alyom News and Mekamelen TV shared images of the burnt and severely damaged ambulance on their Twitter/X accounts.

Ousama al-Kahloot shared images from the funeral where dozens of men, including paramedics, can be seen standing near the four white shrouds.As there were so many testimonies posted online about the killed civilians, Airwars has summarised these below per individual.Photographer Fouad Abu Khammash“Nothing will stop us from our work and delivering our message, even for the last moment, even the last day, God willing.”According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, these were the last words of the volunteer Fouad Abu Khammash before he died alongside his three colleagues during the alleged Israeli strike of the PRCS Ambulance while it was evacuating two wounded people in Deir al-Balah. PRCS dedicated a video to the late Fouad where he could be seen rescuing children and capturing the aftermath of deadly airstrikes, and his colleagues were grieving over his sudden death.Palestinian government spokesman Ibrahim Melhem shared a Facebook tribute to the late Fouad writing that he was “compassionate, affectionate, loving, and helpful, until he became a martyr, and his immaculate body with his comrades was scattered in pieces.”Numerous social media posts were dedicated to the memory of Fouad Abu Khammash. “Freedom of Gaza” Facebook account wrote that during the war, Fouad was a paramedic in the Red Crescent Society, and “he embraced the injured children in the hospital with compassion and kindness.”Facebook account “Riwaq – center for architectural conservation” wrote that “over the years, Fouad’s lens has traveled throughout Gaza, capturing ancient, strange, and under-exposed places in the Gaza Strip.” Some of the images of life in the Gaza Strip taken by Fouad before the armed conflict were shared by this account.Yaseen Abu Khasewan mourned Fouad’s death on Facebook, calling him a “friend”, “companion on occasion” and “beloved photographer” and shared a picture with him in a mosque.Facebook user Yahya E. Al-Farra also wrote a tribute to him, remembering Fouad as a “good-natured friend and classmate, good-natured and easy-going, the dearly beloved journalist.” He shared Fouad’s picture in a blue shirt talking on the phone.Amgad AL-Bohisi, apparently a colleague and friend of Fouad, wrote his testimony: “Oh, my heart aches for you… still this morning we were together and imagining and saying we have spent 96 days in the war… so you went and left me alone. Who wants to come and sit with me every day… Who do I want to talk to and laugh with.”Iyad Khammash, apparently Fouad’s brother, wrote his post mourning the death of his brother on the first day of the Ramadan: “1/10/2024 And this day will remain the most difficult day in my life. I lost half of my soul, I lost a part of my heart, I lost a person who is impossible to forget. He left, and his passing was the most painful thing for me. My brother, may God have mercy on you and compensate me by meeting you in Jannah al-Firdaws.

In the images shared on social media, he can be seen as a young man with a mustache in the red PRCS uniform.Airwars was unable to find additional details on the identity of the two patients who were killed while being transported in the ambulance.Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), told ABC News the organisation was shocked and saddened by the incident. “The ambulance was clearly marked with the Red Crescent protective emblem, which is a protective emblem under the Geneva Convention, and under international humanitarian law this ambulance must be protected and respected by every party of the conflict,” he said.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) also condemned the killing of four ambulance team members of PRCS and the two patients they were transporting. Both IFRC and World Health Organization offered their condolences to the families and colleagues of the victims.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to the Israeli military.As reported by ABC News, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) denied the attack in a statement to the Agence France-Presse news agency. “A review was conducted based on the details provided to the IDF which shows that no strike was carried out in the described area,” the IDF said. In line with Airwars’ methodology, as all sources attributed the strike to Israeli forces this has nevertheless been graded as a ‘likely’ Israeli strike.The incident occured at 15:31:00 local time., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrike, Drone StrikeCivilian infrastructureHealthcare facilityCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed6(4 men1 journalist4 healthcare_personnel)Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactHealthcareImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

The Jordanian Royal Medical Services posted on Facebook that he was taken to Al Hussein Medical City, a medical complex in Amman, consisting of five hospitals. Doctors there described him as stable: pictures attached show him conscious and in seemingly good spirits. A bandage on his forearm is clearly visible. Recognition from the Jordanian royal family was noticeable: the Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II visited.Gazans near the hospital described the scene following the strike. Mohammad Rami, a Palestinian civilian quoted by Middle East Eye, stated that he and others previously taking shelter in nearby tents were “forced to flee late at night, fearing the hospital would be raided or bombed.” Most of those displaced apparently “spent the night on the streets.” The bombing, Rami said, was “terrifying.”Al Mamlaka TV described the hospital as “affected by missile fragments.” Roya News corroborated this, claiming the hospital “suffered extensive damage.” Israeli tanks allegedly came within meters of the hospital. A video shared by Ahmed el-Madhoun showed multiple bullet rounds in the vicinity of what was described as “dangerously close to the Jordanian field hospital.” Similarly, NPR quoted the Jordanian military as saying that Israel “deliberately targeted” the hospital by “blocking the entrance to the complex with a tank and shooting at the hospital.” The Jordanian embassy released a statement alleging that the attack “involved heavy firepower” which included “direct fire from tanks and vehicles.” Some of the firepower may have been directed at the nearby cemetery, which the hospital borders.The Israeli fire reached international audiences, with the French government condemning it. Roya News quoted the French Ministry of Foreign affairs, which was said to have expressed “strong disapproval.” France “directly supports” the field hospital by providing financing and medical supplies, it said.The Israel Defense Forces commented on the alleged strike but denied their involvement. The Times of Israel reported that the military “denied claims” that it shelled the hospital and said that “the hospital is not damaged and continues to function and provide medical care to those who need it.” IDF’s Spokesperson’s Unit told The Times of Israel that the military “did not attack the Jordanian hospital in Khan Younis,” but that troops were engaged in a gun battle with Hamas operatives in a nearby area. However, the Jordanian armed forces released a statement that “this action was not a consequence of a clash with resistance factions,”and that it “strongly asserts that the deliberate targeting of the Jordanian Field Hospital was part of Israel’s consistent approach to targeting hospitals in Gaza.” According to the Jordanian military, Israeli forces knew the location of the hospital and knew that staff were sheltering in an adjacent concrete building. Video footage released by Jordan’s armed forces showed the building with bullet holes in the concrete walls, shattered windows and bloodstains on a bed.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeArtillery, Ground operationCivilian infrastructureHealthcare facilityCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killedUnknownCivilians reported injured2Causes of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitions, Small arms and light weaponsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactHealthcareImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

One of the injured paramedics, Khaled Suhail Abed (Abu Anas), later succumbed to his injuries. The paramedics were attacked while they were rescuing the injured civilians from a previous strike.Shehab Agency was the first to report about one killed and three paramedics injured on Twitter/X t at 2:46 PM. Some other sources, including Al-Araby, reported about two injured paramedics. The Palestine Chronicle reported on April 8 that three paramedics were killed, identified as Hussein Al-Muqeed and Khaled Abed, though the identity of the third paramedic was not reported.Fares Afaneh, Director of Ambulance and Emergency at Kamal Adwan Hospital, said about this incident: “Our crew moved to rescue those wounded by an Israeli bombing, and upon arriving, it was exposed to another bombing. Our crew was bombed while working.” Al-Araby’s correspondent in Deir al-Balah, Basil Khalaf, reported that the paramedics were on a mission to recover four civilians who were killed during the alleged Israeli bombing of a gathering of citizens in Ezbet Beit Hanoun (assessed separately in ISPT040424a).According to a CNN report quoting an ambulance driver for the hospital, Abdallah Hemaid, an area near a school sheltering displaced civilians was hit with an alleged Israeli artillery bombardment when some civilians were scavenging in a field for plants or vegetation they could eat. Abdallah Hemaid said that when the initial attack took place, nearby civilians rushed over to try to help the injured. But then another round of artillery fire killed three people and injured several children, all from the same family. Then two ambulances with four paramedics from the Kamal Adwan Hospital headed to the area when a third round of artillery fire erupted, killing one of the paramedics and critically injuring three others.At 10:47 PM the Agency posted an image of the dead body of Hussein Fayez Matar, lying on a stretcher in his uniform. Later it also shared a video of his fellow paramedics crying and mourning his death. One of the colleagues said that the late Hussein foresaw his death. He told his colleagues that he saw in a dream his martyrdom on the 25th day of Ramadan, the day he died.Hussein’s former colleague and friend for over 15 years who used to study together with him at the Islamic University in Gaza City, a nurse Yaqoub Hamad, also confirmed to the Palestine Chronicle that the deceased paramedic had seen his forthcoming death in a dream. According to him, Hussein had this dream at the beginning of Ramadan.He added that Hussein remained at his post at the Kamal Adwan Hospital from the very first day of the war on Gaza, refusing to leave the northern area of the Strip, enduring hunger and thirst for the last six months. Hamad also said that Hussein helped save dozens of wounded Palestinians, evacuated hundreds of injured people, and provided medical services and first aid to the wounded, working tirelessly, day and night. “Hussein was killed while wearing his medic uniform,” emphasized Hamad, calling for the international community to investigate.Hussein Fayez Matar was also described as a person who memorized the Quran. According to Yaqoub Hamad, Hussein had a beautiful voice, leading people in Taraweeh prayers during Ramadan.A Facebook user Algerian Gazan abu Osama wrote that Hussein was a refugee to Gaza from the village of Na’alia, Ashkelon district, and used to be Imam and preacher of the Nour al-Din Zengi Mosque in Izbet Abd Rabbo in Jabalia. He added that Hussein “had a soft, delicate voice, was polite, kind and gentle, and also the bold and courageous…the one with light blood and beautiful character and morals.”Hussein Raafat Daher also praised Abu Muhammad in his post: “the martyr of the fasting person, the one who memorized the Book of God, the one of easy-going character, the wise one, the son of Jabalia camp, the beloved paramedic/ Hussein Fayez Matar.” Abeer fayiz shared a picture of the late Hussein – a young man in a blue T-shirt and a cap.Palestinian Emergency Knights Association also wrote a tribute to the late paramedic, writing “You hurt our hearts, Hussein💔” and calling him one of the knights of the Palestinian Emergency Knights Association.One of the injured paramedics, Khaled Suhail Abed (Abu Anas), later died of his injuries on April 8th. His death was mourned in the posts by Abo Yosef, Amir Fares, Yousef al-Hindi and others. Yousef al-Hindi wrote, “You joined your wife and children in the gardens of bliss, God willing.”Amir Fares wrote that Khaled’s wife and children had been killed at the beginning of the war. Khaled nevertheless continued to help the injured and recover the dead. Amir described the late Khaled as calm, having a high moral character, and loving his colleagues. He shared his images – one in the uniform and medical gloves, and another one showing his dead body carried by his colleagues.One more paramedic, Nabil Mahmoud Abu Saqr, was reportedly seriously injured. It is not clear from the sources whether he survived or also succumbed to his injuries. Bassel Tayeh wished a speedy recovery for Nabil in his Facebook post, sharing an image of a young smiling bearded man in uniform. Nabil’s wife also shared a post praying for his speedy recovery.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strike to the Israeli military.The sources differed regarding the nature of the strike.

Some reports put the death toll at 50 family members. Several other family members were injured, though the exact number of those wounded was not reported on.Social media posts helped Airwars to identify 32 victims from Asalia family by name.This includes 60-year-old Omar Kamel Hammad Asalia and Hadiya Muhammad Asalia, killed alongside a man who is likely Omar’s son, Ghazi Omar Asaliyya. Ghazi’s children, his young son, Ibrahim Ghazi Asalia, and his four daughters Hadiya Ghazi Asalia, Maha Ghazi Asalia, Dima Ghazi Asalia and Razan Ghazi Asalia were also reportedly killed. In photos shared of the family members Ibrahim and Hadiya were identified as children. The ages of the Ghazi’s other daughters are not known.Another man, likely the son of Omar, Moin Omar Asalia was killed along with his daughter Ola Moein Asalia, and his sons, Alaa Moin Asalia, Mohamed Moin Asalia and Omar Moin Asalia.Hamza Omar Asalia, another possible son of Omar, was killed in the alleged Israeli strike along with two sons, Mohammed Hamza Asalia and Mahmoud Hamza Asalia.A male family member Sayed Kamel Hammad Asalia was reportedly killed as were his daughters, Saja Sayed Asalia, Shorouk Sayed Asalia and Doha Sayed Asalia, and his sons Ahmed Sayed Asalia and Younis Sayed Asalia.Three women Hadeel Mahmoud Asalia, Mona Asalia, and Yasmine Munir Asalia were also reportedly killed in this strike. Two men Kamel Hammad Asalia and Kamal Qasim Al-Kafarneh were also killed.Members of the Saadeh family, Fadi Shawky Saadeh, and his five sons, Muslima Fadi Saadeh, Moamen Fadi Saadeh, Ahmed Fadi Saadeh and Fadi Fadi Saadeh were also identified amongst those killed.A family member, Youssef Asalia, shared dozens of photos of the victims from before the incident. Airwars identified at least ten children among these images killed in the incident.In a post on Facebook, Khaled Ali Asalya also reported on the strike, listing the names of each of the relatives that he could confirm were killed that day. He also mentioned that “a number of martyrs are still missing” and that the rest of the family was “injured”.Facebook user Abual Walid reported: “the Asalia family was martyred as a result of the Israeli bombing on Al-Sika Street in the city of Jabalia, north of the Gaza Strip” and shared a more extensive list with 26 members of the Asalia family allegedly killed in the bombing.Clearer details of the alleged airstrike emerged after Issa Saadallah wrote an account of the incident on Al-Ayyam, a news website. According to that report, around 50 members of the Asalia family could have been killed “without any media fanfare due to the intensity of the bombing and the sudden invasion of the area”.According to eyewitnesses interviewed by Al-Ayyam, the attack destroyed three houses inhabited by seven families and caused serious damage to the surrounding buildings. These witnesses declared that “the massacre occurred hours before the ground invasion of the area and that there was no security or military tension in the area”.Mahmoud Asalia, a relative of the victims, stated to this same source that “the number of victims ranged between 35 and 50 martyrs, most of whom were children and women”, and that the destroyed houses belonged “to the children of the sixty-year-old citizen Omar Asalia, their wives and their sons, in addition to his daughters, their husbands and their sons”.Mahmoud attested to the impossibility of any rescue operations by ambulances or civil defence teams because of alleged direct fire from military drones and Israeli artillery deployed east of the area. Mahmoud Asalia reported that “armoured forces” entered the surrounding area less than two hours after the airstrike and began “extensive bombing, destruction, and bulldozing operations that affected lands belonging to the Asalia, Khader, and Haj Ali families.”Dozens of photos shared by Yousef Assaliya honoured the memory of several members of the Asalia family. Among these pictures is an image of an improvised headstone, made from rubble. The date of the strike, 11/05/2024, is written in marker on the piece of debris alongside the words “Martyrs of Asalia” and “Kamal Qasim”. Youssef wrote this caption alongside the post: “5/11/2024 is a day that broke my back. May God have mercy on a soul that has been exhausted by longing for it. May God have mercy on a soul that cannot be replaced and will never be born again. May God have mercy on unforgettable laughter, features that will never be forgotten, and conversations that we long to hear.”He uploaded a new picture a few hours later, this time showing a handwritten list of over 30 of his killed relatives.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed32 – 50(10–22 children3–12 women11–18 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed32 – 50(10–22 children3–12 women11–18 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, Residential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed32 – 50(10–22 children3–12 women11–18 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military"

He was elected to the political bureau of the Democratic Front, most recently in the eighth General National Congress.Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine – Hebron Branch also posted about the death of Mahmoud Hamami, calling him a “comrade Commander Mahmoud Hamami, a leader in the forces of the martyr Omar Al-Qasim.” It added an image of the young man in a cap.Based on the statements above and the specificity of “resistance activities”, Airwars has classified Talal Abu Zarifa and Mahmoud Hamami as militants until further information comes to light.

A Zanana missile is Arabic word used in Palestine to refer to the drones commonly used by the Israeli Military. The word means ‘buzzing sound’ and is used to refer to the noise the drones make and the drones themselves.While neither post to Facebook reporting the death of Dr Safia Hamdan directly attributes responsibility for the attack to Israel, the term Zanana is generally applicable to mean an Israeli drone and can therefore be taken as indication of who the belligerent was reported to be by local sources in this instance. Another Facebook post from Mohamed Awad also attributed the death of Dr Safia Hamdan to a Zanana missile.

One militant was also likely killed in the incident, with the accompanying civilian deaths his family members.Safa News was the first to report the incident at 23:38, writing about “martyrs and injured” resulting from it. An hour later the news agency reported that four people had been killed in the incident, with Shehab Agency later reporting to X/Twitter that the bombing had killed five civilians.In a post to Facebook, Mohamed Awad reported that the Muhanna family home on the first street in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood was hit by an Israeli airstrike. The post also reported that an ambulance crew had already recovered a number of injured people and that a search was underway for those missing under the rubble.The account Khabar2Agency posted an image of a house which had been badly damaged by an airstrike to Facebook, claiming this was the Muhanna family home in Sheikh Radwan. In another post to Facebook, Mohanna Aymann shared a video of a rescue team carrying out an injured person from the same house as shared in Khabar2Agency’s post to an ambulance. Within the post’s caption, Mohanna announced the death of his uncle Youssef Ibrahim Muhanna, Youssef’s wife Linda Khalil Muhammed Muhanna (Al-Madhoun) as well as their sons Ibrahim Youssef Muhanna and Abdul Karim Youssef Muhanna. Apparently, Abdul Karim died on June 11 of his injuries according to the post by his uncle Samah Almadhoun who wrote: “My nephew, Abdul Karim Youssef Muhanna, was martyred as a result of his previous injury, so he could join his mother, father, and brother.” Samah also added an image of the late Abdul Karim – a smiling young boy making a heart shape with his fingers.Facebook user Mohamed Awad mentioned that Youssef Ibrahim Muhanna was a Brigadier General. Though this information was not corroborated by other sources, Airwars has categorised Youssef Muhanna as a militant rather than a civilian given this reference.Shehab Agency and Abu Maisara also mentioned that a baby daughter of Youssef and Linda was among the victims of the deadly strike. As the exact ages are not known, Airwars as estimated a conservative death toll among children of three fatalities – though this could be as high as six.The post from Mohanna Aymann also included the names of their cousins, the siblings Ibrahim Ihab Muhanna, Jory Ihab Muhanna, and Jana Ihab Muhanna who were also killed in the airstrike.Saed Hatoum shared a video on Facebook of the destruction and efforts of recovery at the same house by previous sources.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces.The incident occured at approximately 11:38 pm local time., SummaryStrike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential buildingCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed7(3–6 children1–3 women0–1 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli MilitaryBelligerents reported killed1, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed7(3–6 children1–3 women0–1 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Belligerents reported killed1, Strike statusLikely strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureResidential building, Civilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed7(3–6 children1–3 women0–1 men)Civilians reported injured2Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.Suspected belligerentIsraeli Military, Belligerents reported killed1"

Chairs and other items are also strewn across the scene, broken and in some cases burnt. Family and community members surround those lying on the ground, some are moving but most are still.In an interview with al-Arabiya TV, ambulance director Hassan Mohsen said that most of those attending the noon prayer were children and elderly people. A number of older individuals appear in the video shared by Othman, and posts shared by family members confirm that Ahmed Mahmoud Baroud and his brother Moamen Mahmoud Baroud were children. At the time of writing, Airwars is unable to confirm if other children were killed or injured in the strike.The Hatab familyFour members of the Hatab family were reported killed, including Marwan Abu Hatab and his son Mohammed Marwan Abu Hatab; as well as Muhammad Nahed Abu Hatab and his brother Mahmoud Nahed Abu Hatab.Posting to Twitter/X, @Sa7atPlBreaking shared a photograph, announcing the death of ‘charitable activist’ Mohammed Marwan Abu Hatab.

While no sources available to Airwars tied Nassim to a particular militant group in the Strip, Airwars is currently coding Nassim’s civilian status as “contested,” given this reference – meaning Nassim is not currently included in the minimum death toll.

Israel declared the strike was targeting top Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, said to be one of the architects behind the deadly October 7th attack in Israel. It later declared he had been killed in the attack, though this remains unconfirmed. Al-Mawasi had been declared a humanitarian safe zone in December 2023 and remained designated as such at the time of this bombing.The Ministry of Health soon after the incident reported that at least 90 people had been killed. Airwars was able to identify full or partial names of 57 fatalities based on testimonies from relatives and survivors, which is included as our minimum fatality estimate. Additional reporting such as incidents of seven unidentified bodies arriving at a nearby hospital have not been included in the lower estimate given that these may be duplicates with named victims. The upper estimate for this incident is 150 civilians killed, accounting for local reporting that emerged following the strikes.Israeli officials said immediately after the strike they had been targeting Deif and almost a month after the incident the Israeli Army announced that they had confirmation he had been killed. His death has not been confirmed by Hamas, and on August 15th Hamas leader Osama Hamdan stated that Deif was still alive after the attack. Neither the Israeli army or Hamdan provided any evidence to substantiate their claims.At least three civil defence workers and one journalist were killed. It was unclear based on local reporting which civilians were killed in which strike, as reports detailed a series of strikes in quick succession, with Al Jazeera reporting “five bombs and five missiles”. The casualties listed in this incident reflect all strikes in that series, though Airwars will separate out these incidents should more information come to light.In the morning of July 13th, the Palestinian Press Agency, Safa, reported “violent Israeli raids near al-Nas junction in Mawasi, Khan Yunis and dozens of martyrs and wounded.” The news outlet later that day quoted the Government Media Office’s announcement that “a major massacre by bombing camps for displaced people in the al-Nus area in Khan Yunis left more than 100 martyrs and wounded, including individuals and officers from the Civil Defence, according to a preliminary toll.”Dozens of casualties arrived at Nasser Medical Complex, with Safa reporting that Gaza Civil Defence forces said that “there are still many bodies of martyrs scattered in the streets, under the rubble, and among the tents of the displaced [which] cannot be reached due to the large volume of bombing.”By evening the Gaza Ministry of Health noted that the death toll was around 90 – reporting that half of the victims were children and women. Another 300 individuals were reported wounded, including dozens of children and women.Leblad shared a video showing bombs dropping on Al-Mawasi. In the clip, a giant plume of smoke rises in the distance as people duck to the ground and hide behind cars, with makeshift tents erected around them. Similar photos and videos shared by Al Jazeera Palestine and the Palestinian Refugee Portal show a massive cloud of smoke rising over an expanse of tents.The identities of 63 victims killed or injured in the strike have been identified by Airwars based on posts from friends, family and colleagues. Among those killed were at least four children and seven women.Safa reported the death a Civil Defence member, Ahmed Hamouda, who was injured in the attack. Hamouda’s death reportedly brought the number of Civil Defence members killed during the attack to two.

Corpses scattered in the streets. More than 150 martyrs so far and about 300 innocent women and children injured. Every time ambulances and civil defense vehicles approached, they bombed them.” Abu Qais also shared videos of the destruction. A child can be seen crawling across the rubble while fires burn around them.Online, several sources shed light on the scale of human devastation caused by the Israeli strike, with some such as Mahmoud Abu Znada Media Platform and Mohamed Awad sharing lists of civilian victims who had been identified and images showing the bloody aftermath of the bombing. Facebook user Siham-Haifa Daoud posted a video showing dozens of bodies inside a morgue and being unloaded from ambulances by emergency workers. Journalist Jihad Taha shared extremely graphic photos of seven “unidentified martyrs in the Nasser morgue in Khan Yunis from the Mawasi massacre.” Adly Abuta also posted photos of some of the bodies of victims of the strike, most of whom were in white, labelled body bags.A number of high-profile international news outlets reported on the strike as well. According to NBC News, “Israeli strikes killed at least 90 people and injured hundreds more in the Mawasi area west of Khan Younis on Saturday, according to Palestinian health officials, in an operation the Israel Defense Forces said targeted two top Hamas officials, including Mohammed Deif, the head of Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing.” According to the BBC, “In a news conference on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu said he gave the order for the al-Mawasi operation to go ahead after being briefed by his general security forces.” According to the CBC, “displaced people sheltering in the area said their tents were torn down by the force of the strike, describing bodies and body parts strewn on the ground.” The Canadian outlet also reported that “al-Mawasi is a designated humanitarian area that the Israeli army has repeatedly urged Palestinians to head to after issuing evacuation orders from other areas.”On August 1, 2024, the official @IsraelArabic Twitter/X account declared that “the IDF officially announces that it has eliminated the so-called Mohammed Deif…” The source further explained that “the elimination operation was carried out in a raid carried out by the Air Force aircraft on the place where he was hiding with the so-called Rafeh Salama, the commander of the Khan Yunis Brigade in Hamas.” This is documentation of the elimination operation of Mohammed Deif and a picture of him with Rafeh Salama, who was also eliminated.” A photograph of the two men and an aerial video of the strike are included in the post.Where sources identified the belligerent, all sources attributed the strikes to Israeli forces. As published in the Times of Israel and NBC, the Israeli Military has confirmed that they conducted this airstrike in order to kill Mohammed Deif. Therefore, this incident has been graded as a “declared strike”.As the IDF has not confirmed civilian casualties, saying that it was a “fenced Hamas area”. The Guardian reported that IDF said that most people there were militants.The corresponding munitions identification code in the Open Source Munitions Portal is OSMP620.The local time of the incident is unknown., SummaryStrike statusDeclared strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureHumanitarian evacuation, IDP or refugee campCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed57 – 150(4–20 children7–8 women34–48 men3–4 healthcare_personnel)Civilians reported injured300Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducation,Food,HealthcareImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.

The school was a temporary home to “around 2,400” displaced people; at least 77 civilians were found to have been killed, with at least 54 others wounded.The strikes would later be confirmed by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Avichay Adraee, with the military also publishing a list of 31 names and profiles released of the targeted individuals.Airwars was able to identify at least 88 casualties by name in the incident, including 79 fatalities. Among this list were 27 individuals who also appeared in the IDF list of targeted individuals. In all but two of these cases, Airwars could not yet find information online that definitively linked these individuals to militant groups or activities. In five cases, Airwars found information online that detailed the professions of these individuals – including two academics and a deputy mayor. Three of those named by the IDF were also found amongst reports of those killed in incidents prior to this event; these cases and sources have been listed below.In line with Airwars’ methodology, Airwars assumes civilian status unless there is evidence found through open sources that links individuals to militant groups. Airwars does not take statements from perpetrators as definitive without any further corroborating source (for example, individuals named by the US as militants in other contexts have later been corrected after further investigation – as in this 2023 strike in Syria). However Airwars has listed below if an individual found through open sources also appeared on the IDF lists, and should further information be revealed about these individuals the civilian casualty count will be adjusted accordingly.Airwars found the names of at least seven children among the dead and three women; the Palestinian Civil Defense put the death toll at 11 children and six women.The strikes, which were reported to be three in short succession, hit the school and an internal prayer room that displaced worshippers had recently created. That the strikes occurred during the dawn Fajr prayers may account for the high casualty figures.The destruction was immense, with social media and news platforms highlighting the ferocity of the strikes. Al-Ain News alleged that “the bodies of [some people] caught fire, devouring them to the point that it destroyed the lumps of flesh that made up the human skeleton, leaving nothing to indicate its owner.” Families were reported to have collected bags of body parts by the kilo in order to provide a proper burial. Al-Arabiya News corroborated that multiple families lost so many members as to be totally destroyed: “entire families [were] wiped out in the massacre.”al-Ghafri FamilyMultiple members of the al-Ghafri family were killed in the strikes; the death toll in the family was so extensive that Facebook user Mahmoud Essa wrote that the al-Ghafri family was “erased from the civil registry”.Ashraf Rafiq Al-Abd al-Ghafri “Abu Rafiq” was killed, along with Muhammad Ramadan Ishtiwi al-Ghafri “Abu Khattab.” Holding a master’s degree from the Faculty of Usul al-Din at the Islamic University, Muhammad was remembered as a “dear friend” who was killed with his entire family.Ashraf and Muhammad were listed by the IDF among the 31 targets of the incident, naming them as Hamas operatives. As Airwars could find no corroborating information online that linked Ashraf or Muhammad to a militant group, they have been classified as civilians unless further information comes to light.Muhammad’s wife, Asmaa Talat Asaad al-Ghafri was also killed, as were the couple’s daughters: Israa Muhammad Ramadan al-Ghafri*, Rimas Muhammad Ramadan al-Ghafri*, and Sundus Muhammad Ramadan al-Ghafri*. Their three sons, Khattab Muhammad Ramadan al-Ghafri*, Elias Muhammad Ramadan al-Ghafri* and Osama Muhammad Ramadan al-Ghafri* were also killed. Another relative, Abdullah Ramadan al-Ghafri, was also killed. Surviving family member Bilal al-Ghafri posted a memorial on Facebook, including prayers in her writing. Bilal wrote of her belief that “those who are killed in the way of Allah [are not] dead.” Instead, she emphasized, “they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision.”al-Jabri Family 90-year-old Mahmoud al-Jabri survived the initial strike only to die six days later, reportedly from severe shock from the incident. Kat Nasser, writing on Facebook, said that “Abu Nabil swallowed his grief and his oppression, and his heart stopped a short while ago.” Mahmoud’s son, Nabil Mohammed al-Jabri, was killed in the strike. Along with Nabil, father and son Ziad Bakr al-Jabri and Barham Ziad al-Jabri were killed.The Israeli military named Barham as a target, describing him as one of the 31 terrorists killed in the incident, listed as a ‘Combat Propaganda Operative in the Islamic Jihad’. As there was no other information found online that indicated that Barham was directly participating in hostilities or a member of a militant group, Airwars has counted Barham as a civilian unless further information comes to light. His activities in Gaza were described by sources as helping the newly displaced, with Facebook user Mohammed Jihad al-Dalo sharing a video purporting to show Barham, who appears to be a teenager, speaking into the camera and seemingly interviewing children about their experiences. “Despite his young age,” Mohammed wrote, “he was working silently to meet the needs of the people in the midst of famine in northern Gaza since the beginning of the war when everyone abandoned them.”Other members of the al-Jabri family were also killed: Ihab Bakr al-Jabri, Mahmoud Ihab al-Jabri and Tamam Saeed al-Jabri. Amal Saeed al-Jabri, reportedly the sister of Hamas leader Ahmed al-Jabri who was killed in 2012, was also killed. A man named Ahmed Ihab Bakr al-Jabri was listed by the IDF as a Hamas operative and targeted in this incident, though an individual with this name was also reported killed in an incident in December (see below). An individual named Ahmed Hammad al-Jabri was also reportedly killed in this incident, and was named alongside Ihab Bakr Al-Jabri by the IDF as members of Islamic Jihad. There was no indication through sources online that Ihab Bakr al-Jabri was participating in hostilities or were members of a militant group, however one source in a comment on Facebook by Sami Al Jabri referencing Ahmed’s death noted: “the brave streets and the alleys of #Gaza bears witness to the fiercest fighters”. Given the ambiguity in his militant status, Airwars has therefore graded Ahmed’s civilian status as ‘contested’ and excluded him from the minimum civilian range until further information comes to light.13-year-old Omar Yasser al-Jabri was critically injured during the strike, and succumbed to his injuries three days later on August 13, 2024. Photographs were shared of Omar on social media, showing the child lying on a hospital bed in Kamal Aswan Hospital. Severely burned, bandages covered his entire torso and arms; burns were clearly visible on his face. Omar’s brother, Mahmoud Yasser al-Jabri who may have also been a child, was killed, as was their mother, Umm Ahmed al-Jabri. The IDF listed a Mahmoud Yasser Mahmoud Al-Ghabri as being targeted in this incident, though it is unclear if this is the same individual as Omar’s brother.Surviving relative Asem al-Jabri posted on Facebook to mourn the loss of “a large number of cousins” who had been killed. She emphasized others had been “seriously injured,” including an uncle, Siddiq Saeed al-Jabri. Other injured members of the al-Jabri family included Mohammed Ihab al-Jabri, Ahmed Yasser al-Jabri, Hamza Yasser al-Jabri, Asmaa Riyad al-Jabri, Munawar Rajab al-Jabri, Tamam Mohammed al-Jabri and Naeem Ziad al-Jabri. The extent of their injuries has not been made publicly available. Naeem was also listed among those killed by the IDF in their statement about the incident, described as a Combat propaganda operative in the Islamic Jihad. As Airwars was unable to find any corroborating information through open sources that linked Naeem to a militant group or indicated that he was killed in the incident, he has been classified as an injured civilian unless further information comes to light.al-Basyouni FamilySheikh Abdul Qader Hassan al-Basyouni “Abu Ahmed” was killed in the strike. Photographs shared on social media pictured Abdul Qader as an elderly man clothed in religious garment. His son, Nidal Abdul Qader al-Basyouni “Abu Al-Abd” was also killed. Numerous condolence posts for father and son were shared by friends and relatives on social media.Abdul Qader’s son-in-law Subhi Mansour Abu Awda “Abu Ihab” was also killed. Ahmad Yousef on Facebook remembered Subhi as a “dear childhood and school friend.” A photograph was attached of Subhi standing in front of the destroyed façade of a building.Abu Asr Family Ahed Hassan Abu Asr “Abu Hani” was killed with his son, Hassan Ahed Abu Asr. They were remembered by Facebook user Musa’ab Abu Asr, who posted a video of the funeral of “beloved” Ahed and Hassan. Along with them, Bilal Abu Asr was also killed. Bilal was listed by the IDF as serving a ‘logistic function in Hamas’ general security’. The IDF noted that he had previously been a rockets and mortars officer. Airwars could find no link online between Bilal and any militant group or activity, and so he has therefore been classified as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Habib Family Three members of the Habib family were reported killed. Brothers Muhammad Jabr Habib and Moamen Jabr Habib were killed, as was their cousin, Mohammed Ramadan Habib. Moamen was listed by the IDF as a Hamas operative and named among the targets for this incident. As Airwars could find no corroborating information that linked Moamen to a militant group, he has been classified as a civilian unless further information comes to light.al-Zaim Family Of the al-Zaim family, Anwar Saad Al-Zaim “Abu Ahmed” and Shadi Raafat Al-Zaim “Abu Raafat” were reported killed. Shadi Raafat was named by the IDF as one of the 31 targets in the strike, listed as a Hamas operative. As Airwars could find no information online that indicated he was a militant or was participating in hostilities, Airwars has classified Shadi as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Mahani Family Four members of the Mahani family were announced dead. Brothers Saad Mustafa Mahani, Aboud Mustafa Mahani and Ahmed Mustafa Mahani were killed. Another relative, Zeina Youssef Mahani was also reported killed.Bakhit Family Of the Bakhit family, Naseeba Jihad Bakhit and Retaj Jihad Bakhit were killed. Cousin Fedaa Kaly wrote a commemoration post on Facebook, as did friend Nour Mohammad who wrote that,“with this great affliction and with hearts that believe in God’s will and destiny, we offer our deepest condolences and sympathy to all members” of the Bakhit family for the loss.Abu Halima Family Sheikh Nabhan Harb Abu Halima was killed, and posthumously remembered by nephew Suleiman Abu Halima as “beloved” in a Facebook post. Along with Nabhan, Harb Abu Halima was also killed and was remembered as “virtuous” and “good-natured.” With their deaths, Suleiman wrote, they became “more honorable than all of us,” as they gained “a seat of truth with the Almighty King.”IndividualsAhmed Maher Sharaf “Abu Obeida” was reported to have been killed in the strike. Ahmed had spent most of the war in the north of Gaza, reportedly sending his family and children south for safety. His father had died two weeks before the August strike; posters on social media noted that Ahmed had not been able to say goodbye because of the ban on movement. Remembered as “pious and pure” and “the best and most excellent of young men,” Ahmed’s sister-in-law attached a picture of Ahmed hugging his two young daughters. His wife Hana remembered him as her “soul” and the “light of [her] eye.” Cousin Hishram F Sharaf was comforted that with his death, Ahmed “joined his father who passed away 20 days ago.”Bilal Qasim “Abu Malik Bilal” was also killed in the strike after coming to temporarily live in the school during his displacement. A graduate of the College of Islamic Propagation, Bilal became a sheikh and was remembered by his friend Meedo Mshar as his “good-natured neighbor.” Meedo attached a photograph of Bilal in religious clothing to his post.Wael Qassem was also reportedly killed. His two brothers had reportedly been killed in earlier incidents in the war. Along with Wael, Yousef al-Shoubaki was killed. With his death, relative Ahmed al-Shoubaki wrote, Yousef “went to [his] Creator,” attaching a photo of his cousin. The IDF listed Yousef and Wael as Hamas operatives and among the targets for this strike. Airwars could find no corroborating information linking either Yousef or Wael to a militant group, so they have therefore been classified as civilians until further information comes to light.With them, engineer Muhammad Abu Hayya “Abu Zaki” was also killed after being displaced to the school. Muhammad’s sister Fatma Saki Abu Hayya remembered him in a Facebook memorial post. Remembering that he had promised her 15 years prior that he would not “upset [her] for the rest of [his] life,” Fatma wrote that he had made her “very, very, very happy.” To Fatma, Muhammad was “the best brother, the piece of [her] soul.” He indeed had “kept [his] promise.” Fatma admitted she could not adequately write about the loss: “There are no words to say in your absence [as] a brother like you cannot be mourned with words, for all the words in the world are not enough to mention your virtues and enumerate your achievements.” The IDF listed Muhammad among the targets of this incident, referring to him as a Hamas operative. As there was no corroborating information online linking him to a militant group, Airwars has classified him as a civilian until further information comes to light.Injured Mohamed Omar al-Masry seemingly died from his injuries four days after the strike, on August 14, 2024.Yousef Shahada al-Kahlout “Abu Osama”, a professor of literature and criticism at the Islamic University was remembered by relative Ahmed al-Kahloot as a “friend and companion” and someone who was “dear” to him. A smiling photograph of Yousef was attached. The IDF listed Yousef as a member of Hamas’ central leadership, and named Yousef among the 31 targets of this incident. As Airwars could find no sources online that linked Yousef to any militant group, Yousef has been listed as a civilian unless further information comes to light.The Director of Gaza Endowments, Dr. Muhammad Hassan Abu Saada “Abu Anas” was also killed. Holding a master’s degree in Engineering and another in Religious Principles, Muhammad was an imam. Remembered by Facebook user and relative Abdalla Abu Sa’ada as “the preacher, the educator, the martyr,” it appears Muhammad was the imam leading the dawn prayers before the strike. A photograph attached to the post showed Muhammad in religious garb; the pro-Hamas Shehab Agency similarly posted a video of Muhammad reciting prayers. He had sent a text message prior to the strike urging worshippers to attend a Quran seminar at the school. Muhammad was one of 31 individuals named as a Hamas operative by the Israeli Defense Force. As there was no indication through open sources that Muhammad was participating in hostilities or a member of a militant group, and based on the description of Muhammad as having a civilian role, Airwars has classified him as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Deputy mayor of Beit Hanoun Abdul Aziz Misbah Al-Kafarna “Abu Mohsen” was also killed in the strike. Facebook user Naser al-Kafarneh offered condolences to the family of Abdul Aziz. It was not a “goodbye,” Naser wrote, but rather a “see you later.” Also on Facebook, Mustaz el-Kafarna remembered Abdul Aziz as a Professor and “well-mannered” and “beloved” man who graced those around him with an “everlasting smile.” Photographs were shared of Abdul Aziz, microphone in hand, speaking at events. The IDF named Abdul Aziz as a Hamas Emergency Committees Operative, and listed him alongside the 31 named targets of the strike. However as there was no indication through open sources that Abdul Aziz was participating in hostilities or a member of a militant group, and given that he was widely described as having a civilian role – Airwars has classified him as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Moataz Rajab “Abu al-Baraa” was also killed in the strike. Moataz had a master’s degree in Regional and International Studies from the Faculty of Economics and Sciences at the Islamic University and was remembered by brother-in-law Anas al-Nabeh as “one of the best people in character, manners, knowledge, wisdom and humility.”Majdi Muhammad al-Tatar “Abu al-Moatasem”, an athlete and swimming school owner and instructor was also killed in the strike. Acknowledged as one of the predominant athletic trainers in Gaza after losing a leg in an accident when he was ten years old, Majdi was a member of Palestinian Paralympic Swimming Team and had “represented Palestine in several international forums.” Many of his family members had been killed: Majdi lost his eldest son in a bombardment at the beginning of the war. With his death, Facebook user Um Mohammad wrote, Majdi “joins his brothers Muhammad and Ahmad and his nephews [in] the highest paradise.” He had, Um Mohammad wrote, “unparalleled ambition, determination and will” and was a “champion” in swimming and nunchaku, a form of Kung Fu. Facebook user Mariam Muhammed attached numerous photos of Majdi, including one where he is riding a bicycle, another posing with a trophy, and one where he balances on a pair of forearm crutches, lifting his leg above his head. In her final photo, Majdi is dressed in more formal wear, smiling at the camera.Zayed Yassin al-Dalo “Abu Adi” was also killed in the strike. Displaced during the war, Zayed owned the “barber shop on Awlad Sidi Ibrahim Street.” He was remembered as a “beloved hero brother” by relative Ahmed el-Dalow.Amjad Muhammad al-Yemeni “Abu Muslimah” was also killed. A former student at the University College of Applied Sciences, Amjad later became a traffic policeman. His brother Ayman had been killed a few months prior, and photographs of the brothers were shared on social media. Brother-in-law Mahmoud al-Amoudi remembered Amjad for his religious dedication, lauding him for his strict observance of Ramadan and commitment to his prayers. Mahmoud wrote that he had never uttered a “bad word or bad expression” and was dedicated to his community: “When the war started […] he sold his car so he used to […] donate a fixed amount every day [from its selling] until he spent the entire amount.” The IDF named Amjad as one of the 31 operatives targeted that day, describing Amjad as a Platoon Commander in Hamas. As no information was found through open sources that indicated Amjad was either participating in hostilities or a member of an armed group, he has been classified as a civilian until further information comes to light.Yousef Shwaidih was killed in the strike. Nicknamed Abu al-Baraa, Yousef was remembered as the “son of the Zeitoun” neighborhood. He had completed his studies at al-Azhar University in the field of education. Yousef was named by the IDF as one of the 31 Hamas operatives targeted in the attack. At least one source online, Rajab Shaheen on Facebook, referenced Yousef with the term ‘Colonel’. Other sources outside of Gaza accused Yousef of being a ‘mujahid’ though these accounts did not appear to be directly connected to Yousef. As there was no other corroborating information beyond these terms and there remains some ambiguity as to their application in this context, Airwars has marked his status as ‘contested’ until further information comes to light (meaning he is not counted in our minimum civilian casualty range).Murad Rajab Shamlakh was killed and remembered by Facebook user Sofian Tafesh as a dear friend, and a “brother and teacher.” Murad was likely also named by the IDF (though potentially as ‘Murad Shamaleh Abu Malek’) as a militant, listed as a Combat Propaganda Operative in the Islamic Jihad. As Airwars could not find any information from open sources that suggested Shamlakh was participating in hostilities or a member of a militant group, Airwars has marked his status as civilian unless further information comes to light.Muhammad Hamed al-Tayyif “Abu Hamed” was also killed. Remembered as a “virtuous educator,” Muhammad was a member of Referees’ Forum for sports games and the public relations coordinator for the Shuja’iyya Reform Committee and a member of the Retirees’ Association. His daughter-in-law Rania posted a smiling photo of Muhammad and wrote a tribute after his death. After hearing of the strike on the school, Rania “called…to check on him but he did not answer, and at that moment I had no nerves left and my heart was trembling.” He was, Rania emphasized, “like a father to me” and “the best and most compassionate uncle in the whole world.” He called her every day to tell her “Rania, you are as precious as Montaser [his son and Rania’s deceased husband].” The IDF named Muhammad as a Hamas operative, and listed him among the 31 targets for this strike. As Airwars was not able to find any further information online that indicated that he was a member of an armed group, he has been classified as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Mahmoud Masoud was killed, as was Mohammed Jabr Harara “Abu Ibrahim”. The Harara family “in the homeland and abroad” posted a commemoration post on Facebook asking “God Alright to have mercy on him and to grant him a place in His spacious gardens.” Mohammed Jabr Hararah was named by the IDF as one of 31 targets in the attack, listed as the Deputy Terrorist Cell Commander in Hamas. However as Airwars has not found any open source information to corroborate this designation, Mohammed has been classified as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Abdullah Samir al-Areer “Abu al-Nour” was killed, and subsequently remembered by friend Mahmoud Harara as his “dear and precious friend and brother,” attaching a smiling photo of Abdullah. Another friend, Doaa Harazeen, similarly posted that Abdullah’s death ushered in “a day full of pain.” The IDF listed Abdullah among the targets for this incident, describing him as a Cell Commander in the Islamic Jihad. As Airwars could find no corroborating information online linking him to a militant group, Abdullah has been classified as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Obaida Hamid Saeed Madoukh “Abu Omar” was killed, and mourned by his uncle Abu Mohammad Madouakh in a Facebook post. Sharing a prayer, Abu Mohammad wrote that he was “truly saddened by [Obaida’s] departure.” The IDF listed Obaida as a Section Head in the military intelligence, with a former role as a platoon commander. As there was no information online otherwise linking Obaida to militant groups or activities, Airwars has classified him as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Youssef Sayed Saleh al-Wadiah was also killed, and was remembered by his friend Atef Sukkar as a “dear friend.” Atef attached a picture of Youssef, arms crossed and smiling.Abdul Karim Rushdi Hamad was also killed. Lauded for his religious dedication, Abdul Karin was remembered by Facebook user Hassan al-Akkad as someone who had memorized the Quran. In a photograph shared by Mohamed Awad, Abdul Karim is seen wearing a thawb, a religious garment. The IDF listed Abdul Karim as a Hamas operative, and named him among the 31 targets of this strike. As Airwars could find no further information online that linked Abdul to any militant group, he has been classified as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Family members Eid Rafiq Atallah and Ramzi Hafez Atallah were killed in the strike. Mohammad Atallah, mourning Eid and Ramzi, wrote that they “loved each other in this world and welcomed each other in the same grave.”Ali Abdul Rahman Youssef Haraz was killed, as was Hussein Jamil al-Safadi. Luay Jamil al-Safadi emphasized Hussein’s religious dedication, writing that the teenager was a “memorizer of the Book of God.” Highly graphic photographs were shared after Hussein’s death; a severe wound on the right side of his head is very visible. A second photo showed Hussein wrapped in a body bag, flowers scattered on top.Tareq Al Safadi (Abu Muhammad), the muezzin of the dawn prayer at al-Tabi’een school, died of the wounds he sustained during the strike on August 24th. El Hassan Ali Baker, the cousin of Tareq’s mother (Naha Abdul Karim Bakr) and Mohammed Al Sheikh, the husband of Tareq’s niece, both posted memorials for Tareq, along with an image of Tareq who appeared to be a young man.Iyad Yahya al-Amriti “Abu Anas” was killed, as was Osama Muhammad Majid. A video posted by Sabri al-Tamimi shows Osama, a young boy, memorizing the Quran.Ibrahim Mustafa Hamad was also killed. Facebook user Osama Mustafa asked that Ibrahim “be granted the highest paradise,” and remembered him as “dear” and “the light of my eyes.”Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah Abu Ras “Abu Hamza” was also killed. Muhammad’s nephew, Salah Riyad, posted on Facebook that “with a heart full of sorrow” the family announced the death of Muhammad, a sheikh who had dedicated himself “to spread the religion of his Prophet and please his Lord.” With his death, Salah wrote, “Allah Almighty chose for him a good end in one of the houses of Allah.” Attached was a photograph of Muhammad, an elderly man dressed in a thawb.Sameh Ahmed Qassem “Abu Ahmed” was killed. He was remembered by his wife’s uncle Abu Hussam Jaarour Hazem as someone with a “cheerful face” and a “kind heart.” To describe him accurately, Abu Hussam wrote, was impossible: “No matter how much I talk about him, I will not [be able to] give him his due.”Shaaban Yassin “Abu al-Moatasem” was also killed. Friend and relative Abu Adel Hanouneh mourned the death of his “dear and affectionate cousin” but was consoled that, in death, Shaaban was “in a better place than this world and its torment.” Another friend, Abdul Rahim Arafat, wrote that Shaaban’s death had made understanding and living through the war much more difficult. Previously, he wrote, “when they asked me, How are you? I would say: Thank God, as long as the souls are fine, we are fine. Property and what we own do not matter.” With Shaaban’s death, “the cost of sacrifice [had] increased.” Abdul attached a photo of the two men, smiling into the camera.A child, Ahmed Saber Obaid, was killed, as was Hussein Akram Zeno. Hussein’s nephew, Mohammad Reda, remembered Hussein as the “best father and support,” and “in everyone’s hearts.” The IDF listed Hussein as a Hamas operative and named him as one of the targets of this strike. Airwars could find no other indication through open source that linked Hussein to a militant group, and so he has therefore been classified as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Sand Jaarour was also killed. His nephew, writing on Facebook, remembered Sand as “My uncle, my support, and the apple of my eye […] and dutiful to his parents.” He highlighted Sand’s religious dedication as ‘the preserver and guardian of the Book of Allah.” The family was comforted that Sand had “departed as [… ] a worshipper and a praying man.” According to Facebook user Khaled Jamal Ryan al-Qudomi, volunteers and rescue crews were unable to find Sand’s remains, and so “prayed the funeral prayer for him in absentia.” Sand was listed among those killed in the incident by the IDF, who named Sand as a Hamas operative. As Airwars could find no corroborating information linking Sand to militant groups or activities, he has been classified as a civilian until further information comes to light.Civil Defense Officer Hamed Mohammed Zeno was killed, and a child, Anas Naser Obaid, was severely burned. A video shared on Facebook by Mohammed Obaid shows Anas lying in hospital, his body wrapped in bandages. Conscious, Anas was able to speak to the camera. The IDF listed Hamed Zeno as a Hamas sniper operative and named Hamed as one of the targets of this incident. As this was not otherwise corroborated by open sources, Airwars has classified Zeno as a civilian unless further information comes to light.Death tollMany others were unable to be identified, as bodies had been destroyed. Al Jazeera Palestine, quoting Marwan al-Hamas, the Director of Field Hospitals at the Ministry of Health wrote that “there were 250 worshipers in the prayer hall of the Al-Tabi’een School where the massacre took place, including children and the elderly. We received 100 [deceased] and more, and those who are less than that are counted among the [deceased].” Facebook user Myskaik claimed 125 people had been killed. This has been taken as the upper casualty estimate by Airwars given the context of the reporting. The minimum estimate, 78, accounts for all those named fatalities excluding the ‘contested’ status of one of the individuals listed by the IDF in their target list. These militants have otherwise been included in the upper belligerent range.Al Jazeera also shared a “circulating photo of the remains of the [dead] of the Al-Tabi’in School massacre in Gaza after they were collected in plastic bag.” Every 70 kilograms of severed body parts, the source posted, was “being counted as one [person].” The platform also quoted a parent as saying they “took 18 kilos of body parts and buried them as the body of my martyred son.” Survivors had severe injuries. Safa News posted a video of a Omar al-Jabair, a young boy with heavily severe burns, speaking about the strike. Kataeb News, quoting the Civil Defense, believed “54 [people had been] wounded.”Twitter/X user @Sa7atPlBreaking alleged that the injured were transported to the Baptist Hospital, where most “suffered complete burns and amputations.” Some, the post claimed, died “on the operating tables due to lack of medical equipment.”Survivors were comforted that those killed had been in the midst of worship. The congregants, Facebook user Ahmed el-Dalow wrote, “performed the dawn prayer on earth and completed it in heaven.” Photographs taken of the debris showed blood-stained Qurans. After the strike, Mahmoud Basal, the spokesman for the Palestinian Civil Defense in Gaza, claimed that “the bodies of the citizens caught fire.” And that “nearly 90%” of those in the prayer hall were killed.A photograph taken the moment of the strikes captured the scale of the incident. A tower of fire is clearly visible, with dust swarming tents in the foreground of the image. Photographs taken after the incident show bodies crusted with blood, clothing having been ripped off in the strike.Wafa News posted a video of “citizens inspect[ing]” the destruction; one man, face contorted in sadness, is seen hugging a boy, presumably his son or other family member. A video postured by Al Jazeera Palestine shows bodies shrouded in blankets, civil defense members tucking sheets around the bodies. Multiple pictures of funeral prayers were shared, mourners bowed over shrouded bodies.Another video, posted by PS Online, showed a father cradling a small body bag containing the remains of his young son. Rubbing his face on the cloth, the father can be seen crying into the remains, until a man takes the body to lay on the ground for funeral rites.MunitionsA number of newspapers, including the Arab Observer and Annahar News, speculated that the strike was conducted by MK 84 air-delivered bombs – which at 2,000 pounds each are among the heaviest and most destructive munitions in modern militaries’ arsenals. However, there was no evidence of remnants of these munitions available via open source. A number of munition remnants were documented that appeared to be from the GBU39 – a smaller, US-manufactured 250-pound guided air-delivered bomb. Quoting CNN, Annahar wrote that “Israel used at least one American-made precision-guided bomb during a raid on the Al-Tabi’in school and mosque in Gaza City.” CNN, on information from former explosive ordnance disposal technician in the US Army Trevor Paul, “confirmed [the explosion] was from a small-diameter bomb, the GBU-39.”The munitions have been classified on Airwars’ separate archive and classification tool, the Open Source Munitions Portal – see images OSMP679 and OSMP691.Presence of militantsThe Israeli military confirmed the strike, claiming initially that 19 terrorists had been eliminated; a figure that later increased to 31. Avichay Adraee, the IDF Arabic-language spokesman, wrote a statement posted to Twitter/X: “A short while ago, under intelligence guidance from the Military Intelligence, the Shin Bet and the Southern Command, an aircraft struck terrorists operating in a military command post located inside the ‘Al-Tabi’in’ school, located next to a mosque in the Al-Daraj and Al-Tuffah areas, which is used as a shelter for the city’s residents.” Hamas, Adraee claimed, “used the command post to hide and promote various terrorist attacks against IDF forces and the State of Israel.” Adraee further maintained that “several steps were taken to reduce the possibility of civilian casualties” which consisted of “the use of ammunition specific to the type of strike and the use of aerial photographs and other intelligence information.”Rassd Tunisia wrote that the Director General of the Government Media Office in Gaza, Ismail al-Thawabta responded to the Israeli military’s accounts as “full of lies and false information.” Hamas has claimed there were “no militants” in the school.In a Facebook post, Adraee denied “causing [the] level of destruction that matches the reports of the Government Media Office in Gaza.”Tahaqaq Press Service refuted claims made by Adraee, noting that at least two of those on the list had been killed in prior incidents – including Munther Nasr Daher, alleging that “the young man’s real name is Muntaser Nasr Daher, not Munther, and he was [killed] a day before the massacre.” Tahaqaq reported that “Montaser is an architect who owns a contracting company, and is about 30 years old. He does not belong to any political or partisan organization and has no military work or activities.”Airwars has identified three of the alleged militants as having been killed in earlier incidents: Youssef Sayed al-Wadaia killed on the 8th of August (forthcoming incident ISPT080824q, with Mohammed Alwadiya posting on Facebook a tribute to Youssef at the time), Munther/Montaser Nasr Daher killed on the 9th of August (forthcoming incident ISPT090824m, with Mohamed Awad announcing his death on Facebook at the time); and Ahmed Ihab Bakr al-Jabri, killed on December 5th, 2023 (forthcoming incident ISPT1508a, with Amer Aljabri announcing his death on Facebook at the time).Rami Abdo, director of the Euro-Mediterranean Observatory, noted that as well as named militants having been killed in previous strikes, that also amongst the list were “three elderly civilians who had no connection to the military action.” These were “Muhammad al-Tayef, a former academic and school principal; the deputy mayor of Beit Hanoun, Abdul Aziz Misbah al-Kafarna; the academic with the rank of professor, Yousef Kahlout, a professor of Arabic at the Islamic University in Gaza.” Indeed, Tahaqaq reported that six of those killed and listed by the IDF were “opponents of the Hamas movement.”*Airwars has recorded these individuals as likely children based on ages of family members and descriptions until further information comes to light.The incident occured at approximately 5:00 am local time., SummaryStrike statusDeclared strikeStrike typeAirstrikeCivilian infrastructureIDP or refugee camp, SchoolCivilian harm reportedYesCivilians reported killed77 – 125(7–11 children3–6 women35–60 men1 healthcare_personnel)Civilians reported injured54Cause of injury / deathHeavy weapons and explosive munitionsAirwars civilian harm gradingFairReported by two or more credible sources, with likely or confirmed near actions by a belligerent.ImpactEducationImpact on services or infrastructure relating to education, health or food supply.
